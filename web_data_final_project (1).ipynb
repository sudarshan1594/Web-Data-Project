We then ordered a chicken teriyaki plate and a few sushi rolls. The chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce. Was not good at all. The sushi was mediocre at best. While they were friendly and the service was pretty good - I will not be back.',\n",

       " 'Went to this restaurant on Saturday as I had a craving for a Japanese ramen. It was packed for Saturday dinner. We were seated at the bar and ordered soft shell crab roll, donkotsu ramen and katsu jyu(pork cutlet with egg). \\n\\nAfter soft shell crab roll was served first, we waited for 30minutes for other dishes. They said it was a little busy but they should have managed the kitchen in a better way on the weekend. The serving lady was kind enough to bring complimentary edamame while we were waiting.\\n\\nThe ramen was served and soup was very rich but salty.(or was my day bad as the cook put more salt by accident?!)I liked the noodle though. Katsu jyu was katsu-don in a bento box style. Katsu was okay, not that crispy enough. I maybe expected too much(authentic japanese ramen and donkotsu) as I heard the owner was Japanese. They can do better. \\nIt leaves a lot to be desired. 3stars for the food and 2stars for the service.',\n",
       " \"This place will always have a place in my stoma....errr...heart.  I have been coming here since high school, and I had graduated in '05 (woot!).  No need to worry about parking as this cozy restaurant is nestled in a shopping center.\\n\\nI like Musashi as it's small and intimate in there.  They have booths, tables, a small bar, but what I really like is to sit in their room.  It looks like you'd have to sit criss cross apple sauce style the whole time cause it looks like your sitting on the floor, but there is openings for you to hang your feet.  Make sure to take off your shoes before going into the room!\\n\\nI prefer to go during lunch as I feel like I can get the most bang for my buck.  When you go in during lunch, make sure to look towards your right and you'll see A, B, C lunch options.  Those options aren't on the menu and change daily.  \\n\\nMy favorite thing to get here is the Ton-Kat-Su.  Man on man!  If I had to chose a meal I had to eat everyday for the rest of my life, this would be it.  It never disappoints!  And the salad that comes with it tastes so delicious due to their salad dressing!  If you think you can't get more salad dressing...YOU CAN!  I usually ask the younger guy server and he brings me a bottle to put more dressing on to my heart's delight!\\n\\nThe staff here is really nice and you'll always see the same familiar faces when coming in.  Come check them out!  I promise you'll enjoy their food!\",\n",

       " \"I just came back from living in Japan for two years, and Musashi is one of the most authentic Japanese restaurants I've been to. Not only that, but the prices aren't too bad either. I had some kind of vegetarian nabe (like a one pot dish) and beef tongue, my friend had the tonkatsu (fried pork cutlets-- they gave more than one, which was a surprise), and we both had a few Asahi beers and a cheap bottle of sake without completely breaking the bank (maybe about $30 a person with tip and everything).\\n\\nThe atmosphere is nothing special. It's a small restaurant in a strip mall, but they do have a couple tables on tatami where you can sit on the floor Japanese style (if that's your thing). Personally, I'd rather have good food than a beautiful restaurant, so I didn't mind at all.\\n\\nAll-in-all, I think I'll definitely go back next time I have a craving for ramen or some other Japanese food that's a bit tough to find in Charlotte.\\n\\nThe key thing was that the rest of the guests were Japanese, which is always a good sign!\",\n",
       " 'First of all it must be said that this is a JAPANESE-style sushi house. If you are new to sushi or the Japanese culture, this will not be the restaurant for you. \\n\\nJapanese style means that when you need a drink refill or want to order something extra, you must wave down the waiters as is the culture in Japan. Americans and we southerner\\'s especially, are not used to this type of service. This is why most of the people that eat in this restaurant are Japanese. If you eat lunch between 1-2PM you will have better service.\\n\\nThe food is also VERY Japanese. The emphasis is on the fresh fish and the rice. If you are not accustomed to Japanese food, then you may want a non-Japanese sushi bar like Sushi-101 (Mexican made) or Rusan\\'s (Indonesian made) or several others in Charlotte which are Chinese. You will find many varieties of fried sushi with sugary mayo in these locations if that\\'s your idea of sushi.\\n\\nI have eaten here every week for years. It is a small restaurant with basic rolls. They are very consistent and the food is always excellent. I have never gotten \"brown wasabe\" or fish that I didn\\'t know what it was. The Bento boxes at lunch are excellent with 2 pieces of big roll, a maki roll, soup, salad and usually a bit of seafood salad for about $8.\\n\\nI have eaten at many Japanese style restaurants and must admit it has taken me a while to understand their culture. Now that I have explained it to you, maybe you will be able to enjoy Musashi\\'s great food. If great service is most important to you, find a culture that is known for that like the Thai people at Thai House.',\n",

Then, had to wait 45-50 for our food. But, the waiting wasn't the problem because anticipating a delicious dinner would make it all worthwhile. WRONG. \\n\\nThe first time I ate the tekkadon sashimi was cut right:  cut thick n all the same size. I was in heaven right here in NORTH CAROLINA. No MSG. No thirst after the meal. And, the tuna was so tasty that it was definitely tuna FOR sashimi, not the cheap tuna u find in the supermarket or Costco. \\n\\nTonight the tekkadon sashimi was cut in all kinds of shapes which I believe were leftover cuts that should hv gone in a chirashi bowl, NOT served as sashimi in tekkadon. I suppose it all goes into your mouth n only the flavor matters? Hmm, I guess I'm ole fashion n lived in Japan too long. \\n\\nI also ordered three uni sashimi. Hey! What's with the same price of $3.50 for an uni sushi when an uni sushi previously ordered on another visit had TWO pieces of uni on the sushi. This time it was only ONE piece for the sashimi!!! But, I must say the tuna was definitely tasty n sashimi quality.\\n\\nWe were so thirsty after eating there tho which is a sign of MSG, lots n lots. \\n\\nThe tempura shrimp was perfect, not doughy or undercooked. \\n\\nStill, since it's near, I'm not giving up on Musashi but will try other dishes next time.\",\n",

The other ladies are nicer, but please keep in mind language is a definite barrier (ex. asking for anything more than the basics will likely not get you any answer).

Her response was \"uh no. \" I didn\\'t understand why so I decided to ask another waitress if the table was reserved and she mumbled an answer and walked away. The first time I went, after waiting an hour, one of the waitresses called us up to come and be sat but then she forced us to go and wait longer because another group that was already sat wanted to move to the table we were supposed to be sat at. It ended up being extremely chaotic because the entrance was already packed and the minute we moved to come sit at the table then the line moved up and we were forced to stand in the middle of the restaurant because we couldn\\'t be seated. It seems as though they tend to favor other Japanese people more and try to get them seated as quickly as possible. They need a bigger entrance, a hostess, and better management. They didn\\'t give us enough menus or silverware and didn\\'t ask what we wanted to drink. The floor is extremely sticky, not sure why I guess they don\\'t clean the floors. As for the food, I really did enjoy the food but I may not be back again because of the horrible service and rude waitresses. If you still decide to go, try the tenpura lunch or katsu-jyu.

In India, it is impossible to find good Japanese food without paying eye-popping prices. When I moved to the US in 2009, I'd expected to be much better off. Columbia, SC where I worked was not exactly the big city I'd hoped to live in and dining options were very limited. So Charlotte is where I ventured for some variety.\\n\\nMusashi is the only authentic Japanese place in Charlotte. I used to stop by here every time I drive through Charlotte or would come to the Charlotte airport to pick up my girlfriend. I moved to Charlotte in 2010 and thought that I'd be a regular visitor after that. The 10-11 mile drive from uptown where I stay meant that I actually visited them even less frequently than when I lived in Columbia.\\n\\nI'd say that the Sushi has gotten better here from what I remember from my 1st visit in 2009. But the real treats here are the Ramen (love the Tonkatsu Ramen) and the Japanese menu (my faves are the Fish Liver and the Beef & Tofu). Ingredients are top-notch. For example, just try the fried squid - perfectly cooked and the best quality that I've had anywhere including Singapore. \\n\\nMy girlfriend had been very relucatant to try Japanese food because she was always worried about using chopsticks. One visit to Ippudo NYC convinced her that she needed to eat more Japanese food. We went to Musashi twice this weekend when she flew down to visit me :-) Sat lunch and Sun dinner! So now she is a convert too!\\n\\nIt is not cheap. But I'd say that it is great value for money - you do get more than what you pay for!

Why not skip the crab anything altogether if the real thing is so expensive?), etc.\\n\\nOK food. Really, not much better (but certainly not worse) than any other japanese or sushi restaurants in Charlotte, and the prices were OK.

The setup of the restaurant is nice, and the servers are extremely nice and friendly.  I love a good bento box or bowl of ramen from here.

You can tell they are home made.\\n\\nCurry, I m suspecting that they use the curry blocks you buy from market, but nonetheless it tastes good.  But it's pricey for its serving.\\n\\nRamen is still not the best I had.  They use lean pork.  The broth is just ok.  The whole thing is average but not overly disappointed.  I m a big fan of ramen, and I rate this over yama in midwood and futo buta.  Need to try the yume bistro next.\",\n",

Fresh and generously sliced sashimi, lightly breaded tempura done right [not a heavy batter used to disguise miniscule portions of vegetables and cocktail shrimp], flavorful ramen and noodles, and housemade sauces for nearly all their dishes, including the light miso-based salad dressing! We ordered the fried baby crabs and tofu for appetizers [tofu was divine...not overly cooked], then a sashimi platter, a ramen, an udon, a tonkatsu entree and the spicy pork belly w/kimchee dish [an unusual item for a Japanese restaurant as I believe it's a Korean dish, but wonderfully prepared nevertheless].

For me it seems they really like it when I come in and converse in Japanese with them. The cook was even nice enough to make me a special order of curry soba - which was great!

The sushi set I ordered was a typical Americanized sushi affair. Not authentic at all.\\n\\nI also don't know where they find their cooks, but I seriously doubt the Japanese guy behind the sushi counter was properly trained in the sushi making (at least not in Japan). Just because the guy is a Japanese, doesn't make him any kind of sushi master. It's a profession, not a nationality. He also was very slow in making his sushis. I had to wait at the counter for my sushi set for nearly 30 mins while the guy was chatting a bunch of lame stuff with other customers at the counter. Not only he doesn't seem like a proper sushi cook, his work-attitude was not professional at all. They need to hire somebody else before he pisses off too many customers.\",\n",
       " \"We were there around 6PM, the place was empty.  I had second doubt about this place since it was situated in a questionable location. We were greeted by an older lady (assuming she was the owner), not the warmest greeting we had ever received. Few minutes had passed, the server came to take our drink order. We ordered large hot sake & a bottle of Sapporo. The Sapporo came out quickly but the sake came about 10 minutes after. Seemed like he had to heat the sake in a microwave. Fine, I thought got to myself since we were the 1st customer, maybe the sake machine wasn't turn on. We ordered edamame & fried squid legs. They were both just ok, nothing really stood out. For the main course, we ordered Tom Katsu Ramen & a sushi roll. For the ramen, this is legit!  The broth is light & rich (not thick like other place). Only complaint was an overcooked egg. The roll?  Wife ate all of it since it had eel & I didn't really care for.  She wanted to order more so we ordered maguro, ika, hamachi, spider roll, futo maki. Nothing was short of excellence!  Don't mind the way the sushi chef cut the fish, the quality was out of this world. This had to be the best quality we ever had (if you look at my review, we had also tried Nobu's Aspen. You know we are foodies!). We kept ordering like 4 round of sushi total, all of which were the best. Overall, if you rate this place less than 5 stars, you are crazy!\",\n",

The ingredients were fresh and my Nabeyaki Udon tasted good and was hot and savory. It just had no spice at all to it. Once I shook in a lot of the spice they brought with it, it became a decent meal. If this was available at pho prices, I would be back. However, with that dish costing $15+, I'd rather pick up some fresh bok choy and some Myojo Udon noodle packets and DIY udon at home.\",\n",

All the food items sounded delicious. Nothing was too salty or greasy. The stuff we ordered tasted great. I got the miso ramen which was super flavorful. The tempura shrimp was very juicy.

A is usually a unique, homemade-esque Japanese dish. Sometimes it is katsu curry. Other times it is ramen. Sometimes it\\'s a little of both and other times it\\'s a bento box. Box B is usually a bento box with a wide variety of sushi dishes and Box C is usually a chirashi bowl. My usually order the A as it is always unique, authentic and delicious.

Dress in layers; this tiny joint gets cozy.\\n\\nWe plan to try more sushi varieties; it's right in line with prices from other places.  It's very fresh, straightforward presentation.  Timing on food coming out is decent; we didn't wait forever.  We had a couple of rolls and they were good.  Noodle bowls could be a bit more generous or perhaps a bit less expensive.  My $11 tempura udon by itself would have left me wanting.  Next time I will probably try a bento box.

There sanitation score was a 90 and something tells me that's pretty high for them.

I asked for shrimp sauce or white sauce, they didn't have any. I was kind of disappointed. Luckily my friend ordered some sushi and hers came with wasabi and ginger so I just stole hers. What it all really boils down to is, how good is that eel? Let me tell you, it's one of the most heavenly BBQ grilled things I've put in my mouth! The eel was cut to perfection, huge portions might I add. In fact, it's hard to find places that serve such huge pieces of eel that aren't cut up. Because it was cooked whole, it makes the eel that much more tender. If you've never had eel, you must try it! It almost taste like a flakey fish such as tilapia, grilled with eel sauce, and the rice just soaks up all the deliciousness. \\nBut seriously, I need shrimp sauce or white sauce. Next time I may order it Togo and get shrimp sauce from somewhere else. Problem solved!\",\n",

       " \"I had high hopes for this place after a friend said it was a well known gem with the Japanese in Charlotte. I enjoy restaurants that are run and frequented by people who know the food well. My friend and I came here on a Thursday night around 8:30pm and were the only souls in the place. Let me also say how hard it was to find this place. Granted, it was raining and dark, but their sign was not lit and was hard to see amoungst the other places in this strip/suite mall. I was anxious to try the ramen noodles since it was a cold, rainy night and it sounded very comfortable, like memories from college days. The bowl was very large but could have used more noodles. I don't eat pork and there were 3 hefty slices in the bowl which my friend gladly ate. Overall the ramen tasted good, but there could have been much more noodles and less broth. This would be a great meal to eat if you had a cold or wanted to be warmed quickly. My friend had the squid salad which was pretty good. We also had 3 different sushi rolls which were named after a baseball theme. The spicy tuna roll was pretty bland. It was wrapped in tuna and had spicy tuna in the middle of the rice roll. The tempura shrimp roll was good but a little large to eat with chopsticks or even your fingers! We also had some sort of avocado and crab roll which was fairly decent. Overall this place was just ok. I may be back for some take out ramen but honestly I could probably just make my own at home for 95 cents and add some veggies.\",\n",
       " \"We had high expectations because the first time we came here they were pack full and we didn't want to wait for a table so went somewhere else.  We came back today and right at the beginning the service was terrible.  The older lady looks like she hated life and was rude.  The other servers seemed okay but the main one that took care of us was awful.  Food was okay.  When does it become acceptable to give bad service?\",\n",
       " \"I haven't had Japanese food this amazing since high school. Amazing, absolutely amazing food, it felt like I was being welcomed into a home.\",\n",
       " \"My wife and I don't normally go to Japanese restaurants because we don't know too much about them. How ever  going to this restaurant was a delightful experience.  family-orientated . sushi bar service, and full service table dining.  staff was very attentive . It was crowded, about 90% Japanese, so that kind of tells you the quality of food served there.  we will go there again\",\n",

       " \"Musashi holds a special place in my heart and I can't believe I haven't blown up their yelp page with my review! This restaurant is family-owned and has been a part of the Charlotte community for at least 10 years. Musashi has and will always be my go-to place for simple, fresh and authentic. No sizzing grill, no fancy chefs or crazy tricks, just the core of Japanese cuisine. \\n\\nSome friends and I decided to go to Musashi for dinner last Saturday. I've been craving their sashimi for weeks! They use the most high quality and best part of the fish so every single bite keeps you wanting more. Salmon is my favorite. Trust me, I kept yearning for a chance to go back. If you're more adventurous, I recommend the beef tongue! If you've never had beef tongue, it is soft yet slightly chewy. The pieces are sliced and the flavors just melt in your mouth! I don't think it's on the menu, but you can always ask the friendly staff. Sadly, they ran out on this occasion. We've also tried the Fukahire Salad (marinated shark fin/jelly fish salad), grilled sardines and a few other appetizers, but the sashimi and beef tongue are my favorites as far as appetizers. What can I say, we're some adventurous eaters!\\n\\nNow.. for the main course! My absolute favorite is the Katsu-jyu, which is fried breaded pork cutlet with egg and onions, served over a bed of rice. A jyu box is actually the Japanese's traditional method of presenting food (how cool!). If you're not much of a pork fan, I would go with the Chicken-katsu. If you're in the mood for some soup or traditional ramen, the Tonkatsu ramen is also delicious! It is cooked in a pork bone base and served with Japanese egg noodle, roasted pork slices, bamboo shoot and green onions. Yummm.. this is definitely not where you want to stroll in and ask for a hibachi grill and shrimp sauce!\\n\\nBefore I talk about dessert, I have to say that a meal at Musashi is more of an experience. There are so many varieties that keeps you wanting more. Many Japanese restaurants are Americanized and that special authenticity of the cuisine is lost. I'm glad to say that Musashi still holds its roots close to the traditional culture. Ready for the end of this food adventure? Green tea or red bean ice cream is the only way to end this perfect meal!\",\n",
       " \"This review is a long time a comin but here it is either way. In my first few months I found myself in Charlotte, all alone on Yom Kippur, which is the jewish holiday where we fast for the entire day, thats right an entire day. Basically, the entire day you dream about what you are going ot eat for dinner, which makes it even more excruciating. By 8pm (1.5 hours past sun down) I decided on Musashi after a colleague reccomended it earlier, she had told me of a secret japanese menu, and fresh fish.\\n\\nWell I can tell you this place has BOTH! And the best part, is the head chef there and owner, is quite japanese, and began his career in my home city's (Toronto) first ever sushi restaurant in the early 80s. Suffice to say, I was pretty sold after talking to this guy \\n\\nThe japanese menu is off the chain and features japanese favourites like broth meat and raw egg in a hot pot (not sure what the name of that is),  they are a little hesitant to let you order off of it but I've been 3 times and just asked the waitress what she reccomended and have never had a bad item. \\n\\nProbably one of the best Sushi places in the city along with sushi guru, yet to try new zealand which i also heard was great.\",\n",
       " \"I finally found some legitimate tonkotsu ramen in Charlotte! It wasn't bland or watery and the pork (chashu?) was savory and delicious. I would definitely come back, though it is a little far out from the city (20 min drive).\\n\\nYou'll notice that the interiors of this restaurant make a particular effort to imitate a japanese home. There's a private dining room, which appears to be a small compartment with traditional tatami mats, sliding doors and pillows.The owners are also japanese, which is always a good sign in my books if you're looking for some lip-smacking ramen. \\n\\nThe menu offers a variety of delicacies from Japan, ranging from potato croquettes (with the delicious bulldog brand sauce) to gyoza and even mini fried crabs. Ramen is by far, the best dish on the menu and you even get a choice between the broths, soy, miso, tonkotsu etc.\\n\\nThe process for making tonkotsu broth is incredibly laborious and takes a lot of skill to perfect. I would say Musashi does the japanese broth justice by delivering the almost-creamy texture of the broth, filled with the rich flavor of pork. The soup also has a great milky-color. Unfortunately the noodles aren't hand made and you can tell they're more of an upgraded version of instant ramen noodles. However, this does not deter from the overall experience of eating a hot bowl. I didn't leave one drop!\\n\\nThe restaurant serves alcohol, but not past a certain hour (like 9 or 10), so you can enjoy a range of japanese beers and saki. Perfect accompaniment to dinner. Prices are very reasonable and the hospitality is fantastic. Food is served in a timely fashion and everything tastes phenomenal. \\n\\nI'm already looking forward to the next time I come back!\\n\\n4/5\",\n",

       " \"This restaurant is nestled in a little shopping center, but don't let the locale deceive you. The food here is outstanding - I got a musashi bento box (probably should have went lighter on the soup and salad I had beforehand) with some sort of citrusy wine. Everything was excellent - it looks to be a family-owned business as well, and it shows with the excellent and courteous service (of course, the place is usually busy, so don't come here expecting fast food, but our order arrived within reasonable time). Do check this place out!\",\n",
       " \"I've only been here once, but this place impressed me. The service was a bit slow, but the Lunch Special A I had was very very tasty. Well, the ramen had somewhat of a weird taste in the soup, but the katsu don served over rice was....I've never had better katsu don. I would eat it again. Most sushi restaurants I've gone to were owned by Koreans or Americans, but I think this place is authentically Japanese including the workers and owner. Definitely recommend it.\",\n",
       " \"It took a few visits before I felt comfortable with the staff at Musashi - I don't think they're intentionally unfriendly, they just don't go that extra mile. Once you get to know them though, from waitstaff, to sushi chef to kitchen guy - they're super nice. But let's get to the real reason why you should go to this place - the food. I think it's the most legit Japanese in Charlotte (primarily because the place is dominated by Japanese patrons).\\n\\nAgedashi Tofu - broth is to die for and the tofu so  delicately breaded\\nSea Snails - one again, boiled/steamed in sake and the shells put out a delicious broth on their own. Texture similar to conch.\\nDumplings - I usually don't love dumplings in Japanese restaurants, but these are delightful little morsels that are worth an order.\\n\\nSushi/Sashimi is outstanding - they have all of the standard stuff and prices are pretty reasonable.\\nSoba/Udon - delicious noodles and clear or dark broth...haven't tried the cold Soba, but that's my next step. \\n\\nThere is a traditional Japanese menu on the back of the regular menu, and I told the waitress that  next time she can help me order from that non-Gaijin menu!! She said she would be happy to do so!\\n\\nTo heck with the strip mall atmosphere - this is just a great little gem in South Charlotte for sushi lovers who don't want to dress up like they're going clubbing don't want disco balls and sake bombs (sorry Nikko and Enso).\",\n",
       " \"Words can't express how good this place is fo authentic Sushi.\\n\\nIt opens at 530.. we get there at 515 and there's a line ... Everytime... Don't let the looks fool you.\",\n",
       " \"Well, here goes my first review to chronicle my life-long love affair with food. I had in mind trying something new because how awfully long some reviews turn out to be - kinda like the length of this introduction. So, bottomline, I'm going to begin with a five words or less review. \\n\\nAuthentic. Attentive. Explore the appetizers.\\n\\nThis place fills me with nostalgia. The menu selection and execution remind me of my mom's dishes and the local mom & pop establishments tucked away in the underbelly of Japan.\\n\\nYou won't get a show with your teppan yaki, but what you will get is authentic, and delicious Japanese food. \\n\\nIf you are looking to get past the more well known dishes and expand your experience with Japanese food, I'd recommend the agedashi dofu, grilled mackerel (get a side of rice with it), and nabe udon. \\n\\nAll in all after three times here, I've left with a feeling of happiness - due to some part of not having a rice cooker here nor a car to drive to the Japanese market - that hasn't surfaced in quite some time, even back home in Long Beach, CA.\\n\\nThe only disappointment was the tonkotsu ramen. The broth needs some work. \\n\\n5 stars.\",\n",
       " 'Simple. No sushi in Charlotte at this point beats them. Ask for Bunta and the Japanese menu. We have been eating there for years. Rusan himself eats there (We ran into him going in to eat one night).',\n",
       " \"If you go for lunch, I recommend getting either A or B. They have a display of the 2 boxes in the front that you can check out. It is such a good deal, you only pay about 8 bucks for either box. The lunch sushi box B comes with 10 pieces of sushi, 6 regular rolls, 2 larger ones, 2 slices of sashimi on rice, some kind of mayo based salad, miso soup, and peanut sauce salad. Box A usually comes with a rice and meat dish and a ramen soup, although it can vary many days. Both are mouth watering.\\n     For dinner, I love to get the Nabeyaki Udon Noodle. It is awesome, it comes out burning hot so you have to be careful. You cannot take this to go, so be sure to finish it. It has egg and lots of vegetables, and tempura shrimp and tempura veggies. The dinner teriyaki bento box is very good, but a california roll is the only option for the sushi portion. Other things I enjoy are the pork katsu-don, ramen, curry katsu, and the agedashi dofu is excellent. Really, no matter what you pick, you can't go wrong. \\n    On a rare occasion, most likely in the winter, be sure to check out the sushi specials. If they have TORO tuna(fatty tuna), be sure to get it without any questions, and do not get the roll, just get the whole slab. Its really expensive but it melts in your mouth. Worth every penny.\\n    Overall, Musashi is a great place with pretty good prices, Lunch is definitely cheaper than dinner. It is in a small but comfortable and not too fancy place. But when the food is that good, it doesn't really matter. It doesn't have any of the over-the-top sushi roll specials, but rather it is just rolled well with perfectly cooked rice. It is the most authentic Japanese place in Charlotte that I have come across.\",\n",
       " 'Today I had an absolutely horrible experience at Musashi Japanese restaurant on Johnston Road, Charlotte.\\nWaitress were impolite, unfriendly wearing some dirty shoes which should be already a red flag sign, but I was hungry, and I thought \"not a big deal\". Well, it turned out to be a big deal.\\nWhere are the traditional appropriate for any type of services smiles? Where is the traditional Japanese hospitality you see in other restaurants? It was anything like that!!!\\n When a hostess found out that I am alone she set me at the small uncomfortable table while the restaurant was nearly empty. \\nI asked to be seated at another table, and hostess started arguing. I repeat, the restaurant was nearly empty, and who says, if you come alone you don\\'t deserve a better seat?\\nI looked at the menu, and asked questions about some dishes, but waitresses did not speak English, and they could not explain me anything.\\nI ordered a CHICKEN TERIYAKI. The dish looked very unattractive: big chunks of lettuce, and  potato salad which I did not order, and nobody asked me, if I want one on a side; the taste was even worse!!! I ate CHICKEN TERIYAKI in many other Japanese restaurants before, and this is a delicious dish, but not in this terrible place.\\nOn the top of that I saw a bug crawling across the table. I killed it, and I called a manager. Waitress started arguing with me again!! \\nI did not see any smiles, and I did not hear \"I\\'m sorry\".

I was originally looking for a more generic Japanese meal like teriyaki chicken with broccoli, fried rice and shrimp sauce. The food they serve was not what I expected but was still delicious. It seemed like more authentic Japanese and was very fresh and tasted amazing. The chicken teriyaki was served with soup,salad, rice and noodles. The most outstanding part was the service. They went over and above to make sure we were taken care of! I highly recommend it!',\n",

       " \"Where should start? Parking is abundant in this tiny strip of stores. Musashi is, from what I've experienced, is an authentic Japanese-family-run establishment. Having Japanese parents and having lived in Nara for a part of my life, I longed for the real Japanese taste in food. U can taste it in their Miso soup made with dashi. U can taste it in their croquette dipped in tonkatsu sauce. Mmmm. When I check out a new Japanese restaurant, I always go for the chirashi to see what hidden treasure I might discover and boy I think I had MIRUGAI in it!!! I don't think I was dreaming!?!!  Back in Japan, I missed the chirashi which had unique sashimi pieces like even awabi!!! This natsukashii omoi... Arigatoo Musashi! I will be back most certainly. It is not a fancy restaurant. Its portions do not speak in volume but rather in flavor. If you've bn to Japanese restaurants run by Chinese, you will b able to taste the difference. Some people rate by volume value. This is rated by aji flavor value.\",\n",

       " \"Mixed review. I was expecting more, but left a bit disappointed. First of all, the directions from Google maps is a bit off...it takes you through an apartment complex to a dead end. It's located in a shopping center (with Food Lion). \\n\\nThe atmosphere is small with humble interior design. There are approximately 4 booths with high backs and hard bottoms with worn out cushions. \\n\\nThe greeting was all smiles. The service wasn't fast, but not too slow either. Our drinks were always full and the server was very friendly.\\n\\nThe sushi list was limited, but priced well. The spicy tuna roll was very good. Do not order the teriyaki chicken unless you like two marinated chicken breasts with sauce on top served with a cup of rice and a side of lettuce with ginger dressing for $12. Very disappointing.

       " \"I've seen quite a few mixed reviews of Musashi and I can honestly say that you can easily identify the two categories of reviewers: those who understand Japanese culture or have been to Japan and everyone else.\\n\\nI'm a bit of a food purist - I feel that if you are going to eat Japanese food, than it had better be at a Japanese restaurant with a Japanese chef. The same can be applied to other ethnic cuisines; I mean if you were on vacation in France, would you honestly eat French food in France that is prepared by an American? No.\\n\\nRanting aside, Musashi has the best bowl of Ramen I've had since leaving Japan. Period. The wife's à la carte selections were also equally as tasty including the homemade dipping sauces - the effort they put in really makes the difference. \\n\\nI've seen another review here on Yelp and I'll echo it here - you have to flag down your waitress and this is to be expected as it is how Japanese restaurants operate.  Don't knock them on service without understanding the culture. \\n\\nI'll end the review with this: if you think Hibachi is Japanese food, then Musashi may not be for you; however, if you are seeking an authentic Japanese experience Izakaya  style, then look no further.\",\n",

I ordered the uni and salmon nigiri and that turned out to be barely OK. But what was quite off-putting was the $2.95 cost PER piece of salmon nigiri. I'd expect it's more like $4.50 to $5 for two pieces. So for $2.95 per piece of nigiri salmon to be rated as good, it's going to have to be pretty good, and unfortunately I'd rank it as even less than average. It's soft, pink, non-fatty and flavor-less flesh was sub-par compared to what I'm used to having. And I'll say that this one experience with this particular order does overall color my opinion.

When you\\'re living in Charlotte, there\\'s not much in the way of Japanese food. And when you\\'ve been to Japan three or four times, you start getting a taste for more than just the same tired sushi rolls. That\\'s where Musashi comes in. They\\'ve got more than just the same standard sushi, udon, teriyaki and potato salad items that you find at the generic Japanese places dotting the US. And they don\\'t try to get too fancy. \\n\\nAnd try to remember, its all about the food. Not about the lines, not the lack of greeting when you enter, not the crazy eyed lady who doesn\\'t call you \"honey.\" It\\'s the food.',\n",
       " \"Best Japanese restaurant I've found in Charlotte so far. I'm Japanese and so I can get pretty picky with my Japanese food.  I like that there is a Japanese owner and sushi chef and a menu full of authentic dishes. None of that Asian fusion stuff.\",\n",
       " \"Very good, very authentic Japanese food.  All of the fish was delicious. On the back of some menus is a list in Japanese - ask the waiter to translate it for you and order a couple things - these were some of the most delicious items!! Has seating in more traditional Japanese style and also at tables. For alcohol, beer or sake are the way to go (I can't recall if there was no wine, or if the selection was just bad). Subtracted one star just because the service was a bit spotty (but it was very friendly) and the ambiance leaves something to be desired.\",\n",
       " \"I have been searching Charlotte for an authentic bowl of Tonkatsu ramen when Musashi popped up on my Urbanspoon app. I dragged two friends along with me who felt very uncomfortable and were confused on what to order. I ordered everyone's food except for the sushi lover, who didn't listen to me. The food was great and I finished my soup, I can't wait to go back.\",\n",
       " \"FINALLY, a place to satiate my ramen needs!  Potato croquette!  Curry katsu! There is hope for the Charlotte Asian dining scene! \\n\\nYes, the previous reviews are spot on-- authentic Japanese (minus the obligatory California roll and special sushi rolls) in a super charming space (Don't be thrown off by it's location next to the Little Caesars.) with friendly family-run service.)\\n\\nThis place is packed with fellow Asians (not the speed-racing kind like Ru San's) which is always a good sign.  \\n\\nTIP: Get the lunch special A or B.  You'll see examples of A and B at the front of the restaurant.  The special is $8 and is plenty of food.  (Last time, it was a curry katsu bowl and a bowl of miso ramen. The other was a mini version of the dinner bento box.) \\n\\nTo the reviewers who had poor sushi experiences, claiming the rolls are similar to the pre-packaged ones at the supermarket, and un-fresh: I urge you to try Musashi again. I always find the rice perfect and room-temperature and seasoned well. Also: to those who complain the sushi menu is small, yes, it's less than a page.  However, who wants a phone-book-sized-menu if the food isn't good? \\n\\n(If you want to talk supermarket sushi, DYK restaurants like Soul Gastrolounge actually serve the supermarket brand as their own...and nobody knows!  In fact, it's pretty good, considering.) \\n\\nI also don't think the service is unfriendly at all!  Maybe being busy and task-oriented (not taking time to chit-chat) is mistaken for unfriendliness...I duno, I just call it efficient! \\n\\nTIP #2: You can't get their udon or ramen to-go.\\n\\nBottom Line:  If you're accustomed to some noodle houses in New York or LA, or in cities with large Asian communities, no, this place isn't going to be on the same level-- but sometimes you don't need all the frills.  Just a solid meal, run by a family you can tell knows what they're doing.\",\n",
       " \"I used to like Musashi back in the days I lived in Charlotte. My Japanese teachers would tell me to go here and a lot of people who knew about the culture would recommend here. I remember my first time at Musashi I saw the most Japanese people in Charlotte ever and I started to believe that it must be the closest one to have the authentic taste.\\n\\nWell so from my old memories I visited again with my mom but only to prove myself wrong.\\n\\nThe lady wasn't so friendly but I don't mind she was like that all the time. We sat ourselves at the bar and ordered a spider roll and another roll I don't remember, a tempura udon, and a chicken katsu. \\n\\nI got to see the sushi guy making my rolls and thought to myself wtf is he making? There was no delicacy. I was surprised when he handed me the dish. I obviously wasn't happy to see the result. The rolls were warm like there was no sushi rice. It was just regular white rice so it pretty much tasted awful especially with not much crab. The amount of rice was ridiculous I thought I was eating onigiri, or rice ball.\\n\\nThen my chicken katsu and my mom's udon came out. The chicken katsu was just what I was expecting, nothing more nor nothing less. Rice, chicken, salad, additional side item and this time was tuna pasta salad? and miso soup. It was good. Just normal chicken katsu. Not so crispy this time. The portion is pretty big. My mom liked the udon. The broth was clear and light color, the tempuras came out on a separate plate. Tempuras were just ok. \\n\\nThe sushi was very disappointing but the rest was fine. I don't know if I'll comeback when I'm in town again. Maybe to get the katsu if I crave some teishoku style meal bc its my comfort food. But definitely no sushi at Musashi. I just want to say that just because it's owned by Japanese don't automatically assume that it'll be good.\",\n",
       " 'This is the only authentic Japanese place in Charlotte. I lived in Japan for 3 years and I can tell you first hand this is a close as it gets without spending $2000 for airfare! The food is awesome. The people are awesome. The place rocks!\\n\\nTo all the people giving this place 3 stars and complaining that the chicken was not great and the salad should have had ginger dressing.....this is an authentic Japanese restaurant. Not the American Hibachi down the street. Japanese is not a big room with large grills with guys flinging food all over the place creating small fires. That is an American Invention and THIS is what Japanese food tastes like and how it is served. But then again American Stupidity on what other cultures food tastes like knows no bounds....TACO BELL?\\n\\nThe service is always perfect. I love the staff there. They let me practice my Japanese and are always excited when I get it right. To the people saying the \"service is slow\", The service is slower because you are supposed to talk to each other and enjoy your company and not scarf down your food like a couple of baka gaijin. It\\'s Japanese!\\n\\nAgain hands down the best place in Charlotte to get authentic JAPANESE FOOD like it is served in Japan in every small town and small food/bar in the country. This is NOT American style Japanese it\\'s AUTHENTIC!\\n\\n優秀食品！',\n",
       " 'Truly authentic Japanese food. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Their ramen and udon are both very solid. The bento boxes give you a chance to sample a little of everything and they are delicious. My personal favorites are the gyoza and pork shumai. I have been known to order them for dessert while the wife prefers the green tea ice cream. If you crave Japanese go check them out, you will not be disappointed.',\n",

They were ok, but lacking the flavor I was expecting as if the broth was made some time ago and then the ingredients thrown in that day. We all got softshell crab rolls and liked them.  My Hornet Roll was very good and the tuna and yellowtail rolls were also very good.  The staff is super nice and the quaint little paper room was great to have our group.  We will be back for more sushi\",\n",
       " 'Nice lunch specials: one with warm items and one with sushi.\\n\\nSushi chef and waitresses speaking Japanese with customers.\\n\\nFree wifi from neighboring businesses.',\n",
       " \"I've heard this restaurant from listening to NPR in Charlotte, so I went and invited some of my friends and decided to come here to check it out. Here are my reviews.\\n\\nVenue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in Japan. If you have a large group of people, your group will be sitting as if you're sitting on a floor, but your not. The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open. It's a comfortable sitting arrangement.\\n\\nSushi - the Unagi (Eel) was cooked perfectly. The softcrab shells are not bad, but I had better ones before.  The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy. They need better selections in sushi.\\n\\nPresentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation.  It was a very simple dish put together.  \\n\\nSake - they are pricey. $15.00 minimum. \\n\\nRamen - the soup was very tasty.  \\n\\nOverall,  if you are craving for ramen, this is the best place so far I've tasted. As for sushi, I would only come here once. I've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before.  I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California. Also, if you don't tip enough. You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip. Its a MANDATORY!!!  It feels like a teacher is about to scold you.\",\n",
       " \"After failing at Mr Tokyo, I chose another Japanese place. I wanted to treat my parents to a nice dinner. Musashi seated us promptly but soon thereafter was told any sushi or sashimi would take  a min of 40min!!! My parents of course said it was ok and ordered a bento box. I ended up eating nothing and felt like so bummed out that I couldn't order half the menu. Never eating Japanese in Charlotte ever again!!\",\n",
       " \"Upfront disclosures:\\nI am a sushi snob, and am extremely particular about my sushi.\\n\\nI am going to break my review into two parts - Typical Japanese food and sushi.  \\n\\nTypical Japanese food: We ordered some pork shumai that were pretty good, but was served with a brown-wasabi-type paste.  It tasted like wasabi, but why the hell was it brown? We also ordered pan fried pork with kimchi.  The kimchi was very spicy, but good.  The pork was a bit tough.  \\n\\nThey have a whole list of special appetizers, but only about 4 were translated into english.  My girlfriend asked for more translation, but the waiter told us we really wouldn't be interested in them, so we dropped the conversation on it. \\n\\nMy gut tells me this place has very good, and very authentic Japanese food, but I am not experienced enough in non-sushi Japanese food.  \\n\\nOn to the sushi:  We chose this restaurant due to the reviews on Yelp.  We eat a ton of sushi and were excited to try a new place.  \\n\\nMusashi has a very small sushi menu.  There are few rolls to choose from, and a medium sized menu for sashimi and nigiri.  \\n\\nWe ordered salmon and tuna nigiri.  The fish was cut rather sloppily, and my girlfriend is not convinced that we actually had salmon.  The salmon was all pink, no typical white-fat lines....  why?\\n\\nThe rolls come in pieces of 3, which I find weird.  I am typically used to larger rolls with 6 or 8 pieces.  It really felt that the food was made hours before and then served up, as the rice was cold and solid - not like sushi rolled right in front of you. \\n\\nWe have not been back.  If you're looking for really, really, really authentic Japanese food, I would head here and try.  if you're looking for a great sushi experience, I would try other places in the area.\",\n",
       " 'This place was incredible! Everything I tried, I loved. I highly recommend the pork ramen. I could eat that everyday.',\n",
       " \"The reason I'm giving Musashi a 4-star review is because I love their ramen noodles, as well as their appetizers.  They taste amazing!\\n\\nHowever, the sushi is down right awful.  It's cold and tasteless, kind of like supermarket sushi.  After eating sushi at Musashi twice, I gave up.  So the only reason I go back is to have their amazing appetizers, and ramen noodles.\\n\\nThe service is quite cold and unfriendly.  I am not the type to want any chitchat between customer and server, but the ladies there are quite cold, unresponsive, and slow.  I prefer efficient service, no chit chat, no upselling.  They tend to ignore you, which is fine, until you want to leave, and they still ignore you.\",\n",
       " 'Just an update, still great food... Prices have scooted up over the past couple of years. Lunch box is 10 something now and Nabeyaki udon is 15',\n",
       " \"Best sushi in town. Apparently they are the most authentic japanese restaurant in Charlotte having hired one of the best sushi chefs. I'm not sure if that's true, but the sushi is amazing. If you go during lunch they have a special for $8.50 and is more than enough food to eat. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that they don't have fountain sodas - so if you order, you're getting a can. But this doesn't stop me from giving this place 5 stars b/c of the food is that good.\",\n",
       " 'Seriously this place is a diamond in the rough! \\n\\nOkay, so we were taken here when we visited before we moved by friends who lived in Japan for 30 years. It is legit Japanese-owned family-style restaurant, and their food is both beautiful aesthetically and amazing tastes! Can I say UMAMI??? Umm if you even slightly know anything about Japanese food, go here! You will not be disappointed. Both their sushi and dishes are delicious! \\n\\nYes it is true that the language can be a barrier if you try to edit things, but there is a younger guy who works there that is helpful and speaks perfect english. I personally am learning Japanese, but I just go with the flow!\\n\\nOn the downside, trying to call during hours in between openings (i.e. 2-5pm) is to no avail, and so reservations (highly recommended) are harder to make ahead of time. I would suggest calling when they are open towards the evening. \\n\\nAnyway, try it!',\n",

Our server was very attentive and helpful. Absolutely no complaint about service here!\\n\\n We have been here twice. The first time, we both got the tonkatsu ramen with a gyoza appetizer. The gyoza were perfect - served with a chile oil and soy sauce. The ramen was delicious and fresh with mushrooms, half an egg, three pieces of pork that were very tender, a piece of fish cake, and noodles with a lovely chewy texture. The broth tasted of every one of those things - a warm, inviting flavor. \\n\\nThe second visit, I got the tonkatsu ramen again, while my daughter got the tonkatsu bento box. Her box came with a whole tonkatsu, 4pc. California roll, 2 shrimp tempora, 4 pc. vegetable tempora, a seaweed salad, miso soup, a small salad, a shrimp dumpling, a pork dumpling, and an egg roll. Needless to say, we had enough food for lunch the next day. Those two meals, plus sweetened tea for two, came to almost 42.00.

       " \"Super authentic casual Japanese restaurant.  Its accessible bento boxes and katsu dishes earn it plaudits, but the more rarefied fish (both grilled and rare) are what attract me.  \\n\\nThe staff is Japanese and the walls are covered in Japanese baseball regalia near the sushi bar.  They take some time to warm up, but the servers and sushi chefs will eventually crack a smile.  The crowd is fairly brutal ordering a motley assortment of spicy rolls and fried dishes, but I suppose that's unsurprising.\\n\\nMusashi is very casual, and so one needs to excuse the floppy menus, powdered wasabi and pink ginger.   Where they spend their money is carrying an assortment of fish.  Here's a rundown on what I had:\\n\\n- Sashimi platter - I ordered a la cart a large sampling, but you can do one piece each so everything's very small portion wise.   As I said...authentic!\\n- Anago - delicious, buttery\\n- ika - squid was a highlight, very light and with a touch of crunch\\n- surf clam - also delicious, I was feeling their bivalves.   They cater to the Japanese palette\\n- tako - fresh and delicately flavorful.  I chomped on it with some shiso leaf and lemon which added zest  \\n- ebi - slightly more flavorful than usual\\n- saba - marinated and tasty\\n- hamachi, sake, hirame, maguro - fairly standard although the salmon was better than expected\\n- ikura - I got this sushi style and was delighted by the freshness and the sushi rice is great here.  A good touch of mirin and served slightly above room temperature.  \\n\\nI thought the knife work could have been prettier with the sashimi, however, the selection and relative freshness were both very good.  They didn't have any special fish such as toro - they said that specials come in during the weekends.   They were out of uni too but sea urchin is not in season apparently.  \\n\\n- hamachi Kama - very fresh, not previously frozen, cooked with some interesting spices \\n- mackerel - grilled and salted to perfection.  Inside secret they get very good mackerel and cook it perfectly so fatty, juicy interior with a crisp skin\\n- sanma - a little bit of a pain to eat, since I don't do the guts, however, some lemon brings to life and a simply flavorful light fish\",\n",
       " \"Tried this restaurant on the recommendation of a friend.  We had the vegetable tempura, tonkotsu ramen, and chicken katsu cutlet.  I will update this review as necessary after trying the sushi side of their menu.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n- The food here is authentic.  I am not Japanese, but this restaurant's dishes taste identical to those I tasted when visiting Osaka/Tokyo.  As far as I know, this place is the only restaurant in the Charlotte area with authentic ramen noodle soups.\\n-It seems they make their own tonkatsu sauce.  It was not as sweet as the bottled version that is available from Asian grocery stores.  The perfectly balanced tonkatsu sauce was a pleasant surprise. \\n-Service was good, and food came out very quickly.  The entrees came out before we were finished with the tempura appetizer.\\n-Price is reasonable, perhaps a touch high.\\n\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n\\n-The restaurant space is cramped.  Musashi crams as many 2 and 4 person tables into the space that they can.  There is a large area dedicated for tatami room style dining.  That area was not in use and made the restaurant seem like a suboptimal arrangement/floorplan.\\n-The restrooms are single person restrooms.  They are located behind the kitchen and when I checked the floors leading to the restrooms were sticky, presumably from spilled food/drink.\\n-The portion sizes are not consistent.  The tempura appetizer(notably no onion rings) was about 7-8 small vegetables, which I consider to be small.  The chicken cutlet portion was gigantic, containing two chicken breasts along with two generous portions of sides.  My ramen was just the right size.\"]"
