       " 'Sometimes, all a girl needs is a great steak.\\n\\nThis past year has been rather rough.\\n\\nDealing with professional and personal issues, including a relationship that involved the other cheating all over the virtual realm, so the escape to Sin City was an escape from all the stress of dealing with animate bs that usually accompanies the aforementioned.  I mean, what is one suppose to do after dealing with a person who was a chronic virtual cheater?  I attempt to forget.  \\n\\nI had a great time at Hakkasan the night before, so in continuing the positivity, I mentioned to my friend that a steak was in order.  After researching on Yelp mobile for a good yet affordable spot on the strip, Mon Ami Gabi popped up.  A smattering of the reviews were sarcastic regarding the location right on the strip but otherwise, the positive reviews and photos further accentuated my friend\\'s previous positive experience.  Mon Ami Gabi, here we come!\\n\\nFirst, as a return visitor, one can consume food anywhere in a building but to have a great meal with the sights and sounds that is Vegas?  Even better.  My friend made the reservations through Open Table/App via Yelp mobile and in the \"notes section\" I instructed my friend to state we wanted seating on the outdoor patio closer to the railing.\\n\\nImagine our delight that the 6:45 reservations for patio seating was confirmed and we were seated immediately with third row views of the Bellagio as well as their water show.  \\n\\nThe crusty and warm french bread came accompanied with a mini ramekin topped off with rich butter as well as a small plate of pickled radishes.  The french bread came in a crackly paper bag, similar to that of purchasing french bread at bakeries.  I ordered the 22-oz bone-in Ribeye steak priced perfectly at $39.95 medium rare and it arrived perfectly sitting atop a bed of frites and a sprigs of watercress, which lent a slightly spicy accompaniment to the amazingly tender Ribeye.  I only had to cut into the steak twice and the steak gave way.  I also ordered the side of mushrooms, which seemed to be a great mix of exotics as well as Crimini mushrooms sautéed in a red wine butter sauce.  My steak came accompanied with Bearnaise but I had no reason to utilize it.  Salt and pepper are my choice of steak flavorings.  An absolute amazing steak, and in my personal opinion, better than what I\\'ve had at Morton\\'s and Ruth Chris.  Our dinner was made even nicer with 5 more water shows across the way at the Bellagio and the sights and sounds that make Vegas the loudest and flashiest fun spot in NV.\\n\\nWhat has Sin City taught me?  That I am not one to forget nor forgive.  Especially when the virtual indiscretions were that of the abnormal kind.\\n\\nAt least I know that Mon Ami Gabi will always offer great steaks and service and I look forward to my return visit very soon.',\n",
       " 'Mediocre food, very loud.  Filet mignon au poivre ordered \"medium\" was virtually raw on one end of the steak with only a hint of sauce.  Very bland. The \"famous\" fries are greasy strips of potato skins.  House salad was decent.  Service was OK, but the kitchen was painfully slow. 45 minutes to receive entree.  Not impressed.  $100 per person.  Won\\'t be back.',\n",
       " 'I have been here three times now and I keep on coming back. I recommend making a reservation ahead of time if you are planning on going here on a weekend of dinner as all three times there has been a long line and a long wait but thankfully we had a reservation.  I partly come back because they have separate gluten-free menu, which I really appreciate. They even bring you your own plate (so no cross contamination) with several slices of gluten-free bread, butter, and olives. Their dishes are also marked with an allergen marker. ( big group 13 vet attentive). I think the food is pretty tasty and not too expensive for what you get, especially in Vegas. Two of the times I have come here it has been with a group of 13 and a group of 25 and we still had good service.',\n",
       " \"This place has such great atmosphere & ambiance. On a Friday night, we thought we might need reservations for the patio but my husband & I decided to just go. When we got there around 8pm, there was a 15-20 minute wait for the patio (not bad!). My husband orders the filet mignon & I had the swordfish special. His steak was cooked perfectly & it melted in your mouth. My swordfish was delicious. Both of our portions were good size. They even gave us a complimentary mini bottle of champagne because we were celebrating our anniversary. We loved this place! We'll definitely be back!\",\n",
       " \"Here's my FAST restaurant review:\\nFood:  Excellent and not overpriced (I ate the trout)\\nAmbiance:  Excellent, I wouldn't necessarily wait the extra time just to sit outside, unless you want the view, which I did, but the fountains at the Bellagio are hard to see through the trees and traffic.  It's a little loud if you're looking for a more quiet, romantic setting.\\nService:  Excellent.  My wait at 8:30pm was 40min (for outdoor seating).  Once I ordered, my food was out in less than 10min.  The servers were very attentive.\\nThumbs...up (two!)\",\n",
       " \"Some might have had a good meal or two here but my experience wasn't good. \\n\\nI got the oysters and I took a closer look at them. I saw tiny little wormlike insects swarming all over them. \\n\\nTiny little black maggots looking things in my oysters, I was pretty grossed out so I didn't eat that night and the nice waiter apologized but the manager was a douchebag didn't seem to give a crap. My friend got steak frites. Steak was dry tasteless and fries were soggy.\\n\\n* horrible management, rude manager\\n* the wait was so long\\n* contaminated, disease ridden food.\",\n",
       " \"I went here for a team function on one of the evening's of my company's sales conference.  The place was a little crowded and dim but it was a festive and enjoyable experience.\\n\\nThe waiter was great and definitely made the experience better.  We shared 6 bottles of wine, 5 appetizers, and 3 salads.  I am not a big fan of pate, but you definitely have to try it here.  The Mon Ami Shrimp Gabi wasn't quite as good as advertised, but I loved the scallops.\\n\\nOne of the special's of the day was Beef Wellington, and basically I made up my mind right there.  Half of the group did the same.  The dish was in a nice wine reduction mushroom sauce and sauteed spinach.  The crust was flakey and the beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender.\\n\\nThe price was a bit steep, but hey it's Vegas.  I don't particularly like the Paris hotel and casion, but I'd definitely come to Mon Ami Gabi again.\",\n",
       " \"Similar to other reviewers, we got a good view of the Bellagio fountain from our table. The Hangar Steak and Filet Mignon were great, loved the brie and french onion soup. Obviously, it's a nice french restaurant and the service and food are top notch.  It's a great option for something along the strip. We made reservations via opentable and it was easy and convenient.  Would definitely come back for dinner, as well as lunch, brunch, anything.\",\n",
       " \"This is my go-to staple breakfast place anytime I'm in Vegas (which happens to be about 4-5 times a year!) I haven't stayed at Paris in a long time, but find this restaurant to be worth the cab ride for a big breakfast. I'll wake up early for it ( which isn't always easy in Vegas), and I'll even eat alone if no one wants to get up with me. It's that good! \\n\\nI love pretty much everything on their menu, including their fresh baguettes, that are served with Nutella, and their other pastry, French toast, and waffle items. But, the breakfast I usually stick to is the Croque Monseiur. Two crispy pieces of bread with melted gruyere cheese in between, served with an egg over easy on top. Heaven on a plate! Also must have is their coffee, which is served in a cup, or if you love it like I do, can be served in a bowl. Yeah, it's a bit weird to sip coffee out of a bowl, but I'll do it. Because it's that good! Sitting on their patio, overlooking the strip with this meal, just can't be beat!\\n\\nCan't wait to head back...yum, yum!\",\n",
       " \"I have went to Vegas and passed this place so many times and I ask my self why?? It is prime location and it is affortable and was/is the BEST meal I have ever have. \\n\\nOh my god I was going to get the fish but I am so glad I didn't because the steak was to die for even if you not a steak fan WOW. And you have to have the french fries so good. I wish you could order a plate of food online. I went on my birthday and it was perfect!\",\n",
       " 'Possibly one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas! The customer service was amazing and the food was so perfect. Great ambiance with indoor & outdoor seating options. Our table faced the Bellagio so we were able to watch the water show as well. \\n\\nI would recommend making a reservation - especially if you have a larger group. We were seated in less than 5 minutes.',\n",
       " \"I came here with my cousins and friends for my cousin's bachelorette dinner last weekend.  I ordered the prime rib special, which was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and was huge enough for me to have over 2 meals!  I also got the onion soup, which is supposed to be their best soup, but it was just a bit salty for me.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy it though.  My cousins had the seafood platter, which came with fresh lobster, oysters, shrimps, and tuna tartar.  It looked AMAZING! I only got to try the tuna tartar which was delicious, and my cousins were very happy with their choice of the seafood platter.\\n\\nThe server was also very accommodating to our group of 12 ladies, and even brought out a complimentary dessert for the bride-to-be.\",\n",
       " \"Just no. This was my second time here and I can wholeheartedly tell you I can make better filet mignon at my house. I asked for medium rare and it was RAW. Their frites (fancy fries) are sh*t. Scallops were rubbery. Pretty much the highlight of my evening was the fresh bread. It is not worth the experience for the price you are paying. Inconsistency loses customers and free desert doesn't give me amnesia. Vegas is filled with amazing dining experiences, pick another restaurant.\",\n",
       " 'Ok is a most go in  Vegas ! If you want to eat in the best spot in Vegas is here !! \\nFirst you have the bellagio fountain in front of you !! And French food always is expensive here not !! The size are perfect no little !! Very good size\\nThe oven goat cheese is a most ! And the Merlot meat !! Also ! The scargot were ok , nothing to say ! \\nBut everything else perfect ! The dessert that we order was the creame brûlée and was excellent !!',\n",
       " 'The only reason I rated this \"average\" is because there was very little to choose from for vegetarian options. I decided on a mushroom risotto dish that was good, but it would have been great to have more choices. The only reason we went here is because we were given a gift card to go, so of course we were going to use it. The inside of the restaurant is very nice--it certainly doesn\\'t feel like you\\'re in Vegas. The service was prompt, our reservation through Open Table was quickly honored (first time using it so I was a bit nervous it\\'d get lost), and we were treated very well indeed. \\n\\nIf you\\'re a seafood lover, you\\'d be in heaven. If you\\'re a veghead, not so much, but at least stop in for a drink.',\n",
       " \"I was waiting for a friend and stopped by for lunch here. Had to wait 40min for an outdoor table but totally worth it to see the bellagio fountains across the street, had the lobster roll on brioche bun, it was the best one I've ever had. Very reasonable drinks and lunch for myself was around $30\",\n",
       " 'This is hands down one of the best restaurants I\\'ve been to. The view of the Bellagio fountains in the patio is amazing. The environment, the music and the weather make the experience one of the best on the strip. The food is delicious. We had the goat cheese for appetizer with bread for dipping. All four of us ordered different steaks. They were so tender and the sauces that complimented them were all so rich and tasty. The rest of the table ordered creme brûlée and they loved it. We also had the Pinot Noir \"Hobnob\" throughout dinner that was smooth. The service is exceptional. While most restaurants lack customer service and friendliness, Mon Ami Gabi is above par and sets the bar high. Please ask for Doug out in the patio. He is pleasant and makes your dining experience exceptional and one to remember.',\n",
       " \"In a sea of strip restaurants that are out to rip off tourists, this place is a masterpiece of excellent customer service and incredible food at reasonable prices - a rare gem in Las Vegas.  As a testament to their quality, they serve between 600 and 900 customers per day - obviously proof of a great business model.\\n\\nAmazing menu items: (not complete list, of course)\\n1) Filet mignon steak, merlot butter\\n2) Ribeye steak. wow\\n3) Chicken liver mousse pate\\n4) Scallop appetizer\\n5) House white wine\\n\\nHowever, if you want patio seating, get there early and be ready to wait.  It's totally worth it, though; you get sunset and the bellagio fountain show.  For me and my friends, this is the go-to place for a great meal - at least a dozen trips and counting.\",\n",
       " 'We made reservation thru yelp - first time doing so - and it was a seamless experience.  We were planning to go to a show from 6-8 so made dinner reservations at 9.  Plans changed and we were idle and hungry at 7:30.  We decided to head over and see if we could move up the reservation, but were dismayed to see a long line up.  We asked anyway and the hostess found my yelp reservation (yay!) and said, \"of course.  would you like to eat now?\".\\nThe place was packed the night before NYE as we were led thru the space to our cozy little table for 2. \\nOur waiter Franciose was spectacular.  Sooooooo charming and attended to every little detail. The amuse bouche that came with the bread was an addictive little slaw of grated beets, fennel and a peppery vinaigrette.  Could have eaten a large salad plate of the stuff.  Franciose was very happy to describe all the ingredients to us.  Hopefully it can be replicated at home!  We sampled a plate of 3 cheeses which were all divine.   I had the 2 specials of the night Parsnip soup and Dover Sole Menueire.  My husband had French Onion soup and Steak Bordelaise. \\nFood was fantastic, by any standard.  Service tonight was superstar!!!',\n",
       " \"Ugh.  How is this place so well-reviewed?  Spending ninety bucks for a meal that is, honestly, not even mediocre -- I don't see how that gets good reviews.\\n\\nI had the roast chicken, and my lady had a steak.  The steak was ordered medium rare, but was delivered beyond well done.  The chicken was actually cooked nicely, but barely seasoned at all and greasy.  Ceaser salad was maybe 3 ceaser leaves with very little flair of any kind, and not much flavor.\\n\\nThe waitress was sweet, and our outside view was pretty.  The bread and carrot thing was tasty -- I still had high hopes at that point =).\\n\\nAnd the Frites -- how could you rave about them?  I found them old-tasting and unflavorful -- like a curled-up mass of stale pringles.  Maybe we just got an off evening, but the food was a severe disappointment.\",\n",
       " 'The breakfast was great (eggs Benedict, wife had spinach and goat cheese omelet (really good)); however, bacon was burnt and dining room was quite warm to 12 out of 15 people in our party, hence the four stars. They did turn on the ac at our request. The service was exceptional for a casino restaurant I will definitely come back.',\n",

If it was good though it would be worth it I'm all for that. But I think there's a brand by the name of simply potatoes that I found at a grocery store that was just as good\\n\\nListen I know you want to act cool, and be a tourist, any eat French cuisine.  Here's my recommendation-  take that same money that you have and find a better place. \\n\\nService is great. That's not the issue. The food is just very very very basic.

Both were amazing! Rosa suggested the sangría as a great compliment to our food and she was right.

We had reservations and were seated quickly. Our table faced the strip with a nice view but the curtains had clumps of loose strings hanging off the seams. Hardly a deal breaker but also pretty shabby and hard to miss.  Drink orders came quick along with a nice warm baguette and butter. Iced tea was good but very cloudy. We both ordered onion soup. She had the quiche lorraine and I tried to have a steak sandwich. The soups were delicious, lots of melted cheese and decent amount of onion.  We both liked them very much. Right after we got our soups, the rest of our food arrived. I told them we were still eating the soup and the food runner asked us if 5 minutes would be ok to return. I said sure and and that I hoped they'd still be hot. We finished our soup and after a few min our food arrived. Mom loved her quiche. I tried it and it was very good. The steak sandwich was not good. The first bite was like leather and the meat was sliced way too thick. On the second bite, the bun pulled apart as I tried to bite thru the meat. I sent it back. Very polite apologies all around. The second sandwich came quickly along with more gracious apologies. Our waiter, who was very nice and professional the entire time, waited for me to take a bite. After a  bite he asked me how it was and I told him that the first bite was pretty bad. Second bite confirmed it, the meat was too tough to bite through, pulled out of the bun trying to bite through it. I told him it was just as bad and that I was done, just to bring me the check and I'd cut my losses. Again more gracious apologies from him and a manager. The manager asked if there was anything else I'd like and offered us free deserts. I said no, helped Mom finish her quiche,  paid the $35 and left. Our waiter and the manager were very nice and the room is pretty and the menu has plenty of tasty looking items but I'm not going to rush back.\",\n",

So much garlic and butter. \\n\\nI got the classic steak frites while the boyfriend got the filet mignon. I really should have ordered my steak medium rare, because I didn't realize how thin of a slice the steak was going to be and ended up coming out kind of dry.

We were seated by a group of teenagers who asked if it was ok for them to spill into our table because they had so many people. We were fine with it but I appreciated the staff coming by and asking if we were being bothered. We ordered a sandwich and a salad both which were really good but again nothing that blew me away.

I\\'m surprised that kind of lax carding policy is tolerated. He was also I  general just a little bit off with his timing, e.g. bringing the dinner wine before we had finished the appetizer sangria.

Get the hint! Sometimes people don\\'t drink and don\\'t want to be pressured into drinking! Seriously rude, especially considering that some people might be recovering from addiction or might be on medication. \\n\\n(2) When dessert was served, our waitress dropped the little spoons in front of us from a height of maybe three inches... it felt kind of like she just threw the silverware down.

We got seated on the patio and we had a perfect view to see the foundation show (3x heh) and they had the heaters out to keep you warm. Our waiter was great, he knows the menu very well and made good recommendations. First we got the complimentary baguette-reminds me of my time in Paris, very crispy and soft! The pate was heavenly! It was a good portion and we ate the entire baguette and pate! Our entrees was the pasta and beef Wellington (better than in London) both delicious. Only downside of our meal was the dessert. Forgot what it was called but it was a hard sponge cake with chocolate sauce and ice cream. We could have skipped it. \\n\\nCan't wait to go back to Vegas to eat here again. I want to try brunch next!\",\n",
       " 'Fantastic Brunch with great views and good service. \\nWe stopped in around 12 on Saturday and there was a line for the patio seating. We were hungry so we opted to sit anywhere, but we ended up with a seat against the window, facing the Bellagio fountains. Much better than outside!\\n\\nWe both had the Eggs Benedict with hash browns and I thought it was really good. Good size meal, decently priced, mimosas and a view! what else could you want?',\n",

       " \"I'm certain that every single person that has been to Vegas have at one point or another noticed this restaurant. It's really hard to miss with their gorgeous sidewalk cafe with a great view of the Bellagio fountains. My family and I ate here for our little brother's birthday. I have to give them a lot of credit for service because we gave them an almost impossible feat. Due to poor time management on our part, we had a little over an hour before we had to get to our show. Our server somehow managed to expedite our food and we were able to get to our show on time. \\n\\nWe started with the classic Caesar Salad and their house bread which came with some carrot slaw. I actually didn't care for it much. It was really ordinary and I've definitely had better at a much lower caliber restaurant. The bread was good though and so was the carrot slaw that came with it. For our entrees, we ordered the Fish and Chips, the Cheeseburger with frites, and Roasted Chicken. Sounds like ordinary dishes but they were executed perfectly. Everything was seasoned nicely, and cooked right. The fish was really good. Probably the best piece of fish I've had at a restaurant. My little brother enjoyed his chicken dish and pretty much inhaled it. I think the frites here are pretty special. I haven't had fries quite like these before. Thin and perfectly crispy. Loved them. \\n\\nI want to come back and have a longer meal next time. Come check it out because it's well worth the money. Next time,  brunch it is! 4/5\",\n",

They always start you off with a complimentary warm french baguette, shredded carrot salad and whipped butter. They have delicious french onion soup, which tasted similar to the one I had in Paris. Their frites are perfect. If you feel like sharing, try the chilled seafood platter, which comes with whole maine lobster, jumbo shrimp, market oysters, spicy salmon tartare. Cocktail sauce, mignonette, gribiche, lemon and baguette chips. \\nMy favorite entree is the \"trout almondine\", which comes with french green beans, brown butter, lemon.

Really tasty when eaten together but I'm not sure if its worth $15.\\n\\nSteak Sandwich - 3 stars. The waiter didn't tell us that they drench the sandwich in mayonnaise. I usually am okay with mayo but this was too much. Steak was okay.. \\n\\nFries - 2 stars. What's the hype with these? \\n\\nOverall the experience was good.

My mother, sister, boyfriend and I came here for breakfast Monday morning.  There is plenty of indoor seating, but I would really recommend the patio because you get to sit right above the strip and you have a nice view of the Bellagio across the street.  Now, enough intro information, onto the food:\\n\\n-Coffee ($3.95): average.  free refills, as with any other place.  \\n\\n-Berry Pancake ($11.95): now, this isn\\'t actually like the usual fluffy pancake, it\\'s a \"big skinny pancake\" as their menu puts it.  I would just say it\\'s very much like a crepe.  It was light and really tasty with the fresh fruits.  My boyfriend really enjoyed this.  The few bites I snuck were really tasty.\\n\\n-Chicken, brie and apple crepe ($12.95): Very savory and a little bit sweet; this crepe was everything that I was hoping for.  There was a lot of chicken in the crepe and the sauce on top was very good.\\n\\n-Ham and cheese omelet ($11.95): my sister always orders an omelet and she seemed to enjoy this quite a bit.  it came with a generous side of breakfast potatoes and some toast too.\\n\\n-French toast ($11.95): my mom ordered the french toast and it was really excellent.  if you like french toast, you should try this.  the toast itself is great, but the sauce, the blueberry syrup is what makes it.  The fresh blueberries go perfectly and the fluffy whipped cream- it\\'s a divine match indeed.\\n\\n-Cream puff (free): we were celebrating my birthday.  I didn\\'t t think I\\'d get a dessert for breakfast; but when it came to the table, I didn\\'t decline.  Very tasty!\\n\\nThe service itself was just okay.  I think it\\'s just because everyone is busy and rushing around.  The service was pretty helpful, but not all that friendly.  It\\'s a good thing they won me over with the food.  Each of us thought that this was one of the tastiest breakfasts we had ever had and at these prices, it\\'s very fair (especially for Vegas).    The portions were plenty to fill us, but not to the point of feeling stuffed.\\n\\nNotes:\\n-If you\\'re a guy, make sure you have sleeves.

I ordered the three egg breakfast ($13.95) which came with hash browns, your choice of bacon or sausage, and a side of toast. The eggs were so fluffy and the bacon was sweet but crispy - just how I like it. My friend had the ham and cheese omelette ($13.95) and she raved about it.\\n\\nWe originally wanted to sit outside because their patio area is so cute, and has amazing views of the Bellagio, but the wait time was pretty long for a Friday morning.

Our server always made sure we had refills and she came by frequently to make sure that our food was tasting good.\\n\\nIf you're big on brunch, I highly suggest Mon Ami Gabi - it's a cute restaurant in the heart of the Strip with a solid menu no matter what time of day.\",\n",

I had poached eggs with corned beef hash and it was really tasty.  Sitting on the patio is totally worth it, the people viewing, being across from Belagio fountains and the Paris atmosphere was better than expected.

Our server was a true gentleman and was knowledgeable about the menu, so that was also not a concern. But the food was where I was a little bothered. First let me say that the bread and presentation is delicious and well-thought out, respectively. I was super excited to eat the Steak Frites, which is usually one of my favorite combinations, but very disappointed in the fact that they use grain-feed beef and are proud of it, as described on the menu. EW. As a quality meat lover and Paleo-enthusiast, I cannot support commercial farming by ordering that, sorry. As a result, I ordered fish, which I realize is a \"no-no\" at a Steakhouse. Under the circumstances (I was actually grossed out), I felt no other choice, and let\\'s say I won\\'t be ordering that again. The frites, which I did try, where totally not the way I imagined them to be, as they were a weird shape and not delicately fried like I hoped. Our starter was OK...the warm brie, but since I\\'m not a fan of hazelnuts, I wouldn\\'t order that again, either.\\nI hope I\\'m not insulting anyone in saying that you would only like this place if you\\'re used to eating mediocre quality food. If you buy Organic produce and Grass-fed meat and hit the farmer\\'s market for seasonal, fresh food, don\\'t bother.',\n",

It's actually a different atmosphere compared to Breakfast and Dinner.  In fact, I think it was the most mellowest.  Then again it was a late lunch at around 2pm.

The bloody mary's are extra spicy and delicious. So the food was not bad, but the overall experience was meh. I would have given them 2 stars if we had to sit indoors in the dark during daytime hours too.\\n\\nProb a better experience with a smaller party for brunch, or for dinner.\",\n",

Excellent table and excellent view of the Bellagio Fountains. \\n\\nWe both had a craving for standard fish and chips, so we ordered Gabi's Fish and Frites (at least I believe that's what it was called). I asked the server if this was just regular fish and chips and she said it was.\\n\\nWhen our plates arrived, it was not a beer batter like we thought, but a large size grilled cod, without any batter. The fries came in a cone shaped wrapper and were more like shaved fries.\\n\\nSo now onto the eatin'. One thought - OMG, it was superb. The fish had a coconut flavour to it that was just perfect. While the fries were not quite what I expected, they tasted exactly like I wanted.

The contrast of the cheese and apple was delightful. Finally we dug into a quiche Lorraine which in my opinion was the more average item we tried.

The fish and chips were 20 dollars and it's not on the menu. The french fries tasted like deep fried oilly potato skins and the fish was pan-fried without seasoning  (very plain...and I don't think its fresh either).  the Cobb salad has a weird taste that gave me a bad after taste (ew...hate it so much). So I couldn't help but to stare at everyone else's food surrounding our table and wondering what an epic fail that we picked the worst dishes on the menu and off the menu.... ....

Mon Ami Gabi was a great value option for French food in Vegas, but not the tastiest (That's Bardot Brassiere).\\n\\nWe had reservations to eat at 6:30, we got there a few minutes beforehand and requested an outdoor seat so we coul  watch the Bellagio fountains. The waitress told us 15 to 20 minutes as outside was completely full (whereas inside was 60% empty at that time). We walk back into Paris to kill the time... but about 2 min into the walk our buzzer goes off. Always a pleasant surprise. \\n\\nThere was plenty of heaters on the outdoor patio, so even though it was a bit chilly it was very comfortable. The strip was noisy, but not enough to distract from the meal, and the music being played on the patio was soft enough to have a conversation. There definitely is a great view of the Bellagio fountains, and you can hear the music fairly well.\\n\\nEvery table gets started with french bread, butter, and a carrot salad. The carrot salad was delicious, simple but flavored very well. The french bread was mediocre, good but nothing I don't feel like I could get anywhere else. We started with the mussels in white wine sauce and french onion soup. The mussels in white wine sauce were ok at best, the sauce was a bit light for my taste and didn't really hit the spot for me. The French onion soup was very good, not too salty but still flavorful. The cheese was of excellent quality as well, really gave it a great chewiness to go with the broth.\\n\\nFor main course, my friends got the scallops appetizer  which was great. Scallops were cooked perfectly and the cheese paired very well with them. We also got a Beef Bourgiogne which was decent. The meat was fairly tender, and the noodles had a great texture. Again, I felt that the sauce was lacking some flavor or complexity, maybe I'm just not used to French food. However, the prices weren't bad for strip dining, so it was decent food for the value.\",\n",

We were excited, however, unfortunately the experience left us disappointed and wishing we\\'d gone to one our other favorites in Las Vegas that we know would have met our expectations. \\n\\nFirst of all, the food was very good and the chef staff deserves some credit. They sent out a small comp dessert which was also nice. The view and the ambience is also very nice. Those two things are the only reason for 2 star rating. \\n\\nHowever, the service staff, leaves much to be desired. Our server and the busser were very unfriendly and could not care less that this was a special occasion for us and they did not treat us well at all. They were short, unfriendly, and uncaring.  It was as if our patronage was an inconvenience to them. \\n\\nTo make it worse, we ordered escargot appetizer, a caesar salad, wine, and entrees, and they forgot to bring the salad and then brought our entrees instead.  We ended up just accepting the mistake and taking the entrees because at this point we just wanted to eat and leave. To make it even worse, when the server came over, we had to tell her of the mistake and she didn\\'t apologize or seem to care and had an \"oh well, I don\\'t really care\" attitude about it. Then she disappeared for 20 minutes and never checked in on us again until our meal was completely finished. \\n\\nAgain, food and ambience was good, but service was horrible and very disappointing. Whether an anniversary special occasion or not, the service was unacceptable. The price alone for this meal demands a much higher level of service. You pay for fine dining to receive high quality food and high quality service. \\n\\nNeedless to say, unfortunately, and I say unfortunately because this place had a special memory for us and we had high hopes of coming back, but we will not return.

The menu is pretty in depth and I was deliberating between the eggs or a crepe.  Ultimately I chose the eggs benedict.  Good choice in my opinion.\\n\\nThe mimosa is pretty damn strong.  I have a feeling that the orange juice is only in there for colour.  I personally asked for another glass of orange juice to dilute the mimosa a little bit.

A friend wanted to come here for his birthday, so 4 of us came for dinner on a Friday at 7:30pm. They don't take reservations for the patio so we had to wait, and the restaurant bar was crazy packed, so we went to the casino bar right outside and ordered a drink. Which, unfortunately we had to throw out when our table was ready since they wouldn't let us bring them in. We sat outside and the view was very nice, so glad they had heat lamps because I was worried about being cold out there but I was comfortable. The wines by the glass were pretty pricey, but I ordered a glass of red. I had a hard time finding anything on the menu because I wanted to eat healthy, and even the fish dishes were all seared, and served with rich sauces. I ended up ordering a spinach salad with salmon, which was fine but nothing memorable. The french baguette they brought out was pretty good. My boyfriend's scallops were a pretty small portion and just looked ok. I tried the chocolate mousse for dessert and that was nice, I'd say it was the best part of this meal. 2 of us were finished with our drinks halfway through dinner but we were never offered another round. Our waitress was not personable at all, which was unfortunate because we all work in the service industry and of course we still tipped 20%, but she would have likely gotten much more if she had seemed even remotely interested in serving us.

My hubby and I had brunch here last week and it was the perfect temperature to sit on the patio and people watch.  Our waitress was great- she let us take our sweet time and we didn't feel rushed at all... she explained the menu and specials and answered all of our crazy questions.... it was our last meal in Vegas before we headed to the airport, so of course we wanted to make sure it was a good one... and it was! I had the fried green tomatoes with fresh fruit, he ordered a sausage sandwich on one of their amazing fresh baguettes.  I also had a bloody mary which is easily  the best I had during our stay in Vegas... check it out, especially for breakfast or brunch.. you won't be disappointed!\",\n",

Service is always excellent but for the one time when Gabriel who seemed like he was more into himself than anything, \"took care of us.\" Other than that their servers are pleasant, attentive and down to earth. If I had a place to go in San Francisco that was this classy, affordable, approachable and comfortable, I\\'d be there at least once a week! Love u Mon Ami Gabi!',\n",

We made reservations at 9pm but wanted to sit on the patio so they told us it would be a 30 minute wait - which was fine cause they gave us a pager and we just went to gamble at the nearby machines. :) \\n\\nThe wait ended up being 10 minutes and they sat us right next to the railings on the patio where you could get a great view of the Bellagio water show and have fun people watching! \\n\\nNow getting on to the good stuff! Dinner!\\n\\nWe started with some of their fresh bread and butter. The bread was lovely so we saved some of it for our escargot, which was a lovely dish! Recommended! Then we got the full order of Mussels which was decent and the Hanger steak which was not too bad - it did come out a bit too cold even for my rare order.  And finally for dessert we ordered the chocolate mousse which was divine!! Loved it with my Cafe au lait!\\n\\nThe atmosphere was lovely, the staff was great and the food was pretty good.

It was a great atmosphere, but the tables were so close together that, when the two parties at the tables next to us were seated, there was no way I could get up to use the restroom without making someone else get up from their table to let me pass by. The server was friendly and knowledgable and willing to give recommendations on his favorite and the most popular dishes. We shared the mussels, the salmon tartare, and the steak au poivre. The salmon was good and fresh, but there was nothing special about it to elevate the dish as I had expected. The steak was very good and tender and the sauce flavorful, but I think if you're a huge steak person (as in you search out great steaks on any menu and eat steak all the time), this isn't a steak that will wow you. The mussels were so amazing. I would go back just to sit and eat an order of the mussels. I had really enjoyed the bread we got with the meal and was so sad I hadn't saved some to dip in the sauce (I could have asked for more and likely gotten more for free, but didn't need an entire loaf!); I could probably sit there and drink the sauce and be happy!\",\n",

Just cheesy, oniony goodness iin a wonderful beef stock with just the right amount of saltiness. Oooh la la...\\n\\nRaison 2:  The Croque Monsieur is a terrific semi-open face ham and cheese sandwich.  With gruyere and creme fraiche accompanying the ham, this is one marvelously decadent sandwich.  Fork and knife required.  The fries that come with the dish are frite-style:  thin cut and delicious. Magnifique!\\n\\nRaison 3:  The grilled salmon and spinach salad is nice piece of fish, perfectly prepared, on a bed of fresh spinach with advocado, blueberry and a walnut vinaigrette.  Perfect.  Healthy.  Tasty.\\n\\nBTW, for dinner Mon Ami's steaks are darn good, too.\\n\\nA few years ago we experienced an issue with our dining experience, and I wrote to the parent company.  I received a beautiful note in return offering personal assistance on my next visit.  i never took Mon Ami up on that offer, but I happily return, knowing that someone is watching the store at Mon Ami, and doing a pretty good job keeping customers happy.\\n\\nBon appetit!\",\n",

It had peppercorns on the top which were a little overwhelming since the rest of the dish was mild in flavor. \\n\\nThe vibe is fantastic and although can seem cheesy because you are in Vegas, felt very much like an authentic French restaurant. Service was excellent. Would come again!\",\n",

       " \"This establishment is located in the Paris hotel, across from Bellagio. High volume is during the weekends for dinner. PLEASE try to make a reservation during the times of Christmas, NYE, and Valentines Day season. It will be very hard to get a walk-in. There is also many sections of the restaurant to be seated at. First room is the wine room, which is midly dark. Chose this room if you are there for drinks or for 'intimate' time. One problem is that it is near the front where people are walking in and out constantly. There is outside seating available, which faces the strip and Bellagio fountains. It is both good and bad, since some annoying tourist might bother you while you are eating. But the fountain show is wonderful to watch while outside. There is also a room that is inside but right behind the patio, so you get all the ambiance of the patio but you are technically inside.\\n\\nI believe I have eaten here four times. \\n\\nThe first time was with a friend for lunch and both the food and service were excellent. We were walk-ins on a Saturday during lunch. We were seated outside facing the bellagio fountains, which was beautiful.  I had clam soup, brie & garlic, Shrimp Gabi and escargot. We also ordered the Pinot Gris, which was excellent with the meal. The price was reasonable for the quantity and quality of food we had (the bill came to about $120US). Everything was flavorful and fresh. Based on this meal alone, we would highly recommend this restaurant.\\n\\nSecond & third time was with my friends (who are yelpers as well). The third time, we sat in the room behind the patio (since it was hot outside).  I basically ordered all the same things from the first visit and it tasted just as good. These times, were had ordered dessert, which was a vanilla type of milkshake. It was incredible. \\n\\nFourth time, I will say I was disappointed in both the food and service. Perhaps cause one of the individuals with us was a friend of the assistant manager, and it seemed that we were being ignored or just not waited on as well as others there. The service at lunch was erratic and inattentive though the restaurant was not that busy than it had been at any of my previous meals. I wanted to try their Quiche and was not impressed. It was dry with very little flavor, and bland.  My boyfriend's meal was no better, which I believe was a steak of some kind. It was pretty dry. Even though we did not pay for this meal, the value was not nearly as good as the value the past few times. \\n\\nFrom my experience I would still highly recommend the restaurant. I have been to more expensive French restaurants and this place is honestly great for the price. Just do not be discouraged from one bad meal. I would say that  is a great ratio.\",\n",

This last time I was there, I was able to put all of those past experiences to good use to create exactly the experience I was hoping for.\\n\\nA few things to keep in mind if you have never been Mon Ami Gabi.  \\n\\n1 - The best place to sit is on the patio, however reservations are not good for the patio.  The patio is perfect for people watching, and what better place to do some people watching than on Las Vegas Blvd!?\\n\\n2 - Get there 10 minutes to 11 (when they start serving lunch), put your name on the list for the patio, take the square-light-up-vibrating thingy, put some money in a penny machine and wait to be called.  Our square thing went off a few minutes after 11.\\n\\nAs far as what made this experience perfect, there were many factors.  We walked in and were seated on the patio at a table for two.  Our server recognized that it was a little warm where we were sitting (full sun) and offered to look for a table that was less sunny.  She found us the perfect table and it wasn\\'t even in her section!  Plus, it was a four top, right in the center of the patio, in the shade, with the most perfect view of the Bellagio across the way.\\n\\nOf course, the food always plays a huge part.  A glass of house red wine to start is always nice.  The escargot was delicious, I loved using the French bread to sop up the garlic-herb butter left in the dish.  Our beautiful red and yellow tomato salad was light and refreshing with pesto and goat cheese, two of my favorite things! The steak sandwich was phenomenal.  Not too much meat, cooked to our med-rare liking.  Ciabatta was soft and caramelized onions were the perfect complement.  Frites were light and crispy with a little chew so you could taste the flavor and know you were eating more than air.  \\n\\nWith the Bellagio fountain show kicking off shortly after noon (on Saturday) right as we were finishing the last of our wine and paying the bill.  This was one of my top 5 favorite lunches of all time!',\n",
       " 'We have eaten here several times and it has always been delicious. I always order one of their steaks and they have all been terrific. On our last trip we had breakfast instead and it was very good. \\n\\nWhen the weather is nice, try to sit out on the patio. It is right across from the Bellagio and you get a great view of the fountains if you are there at the right time. The inside areas are also extremely nice. There is an upscale, Parisian feel to the place. This is reinforced by the wait staff who are polite and very competent. There is always fresh bread on the table, glasses are kept filled, and the meals are served promptly.',\n",
       " \"So I finally got to try this place out today.\\n\\nCame here with the boyfriend around noon. We started off with the duck. 5 stars. The meat was so delicious and tender. It fell right off the bone. Neither one of us are a cherry fan, but we liked the cherries that came with this appetizer.\\n\\nFor the entree, I had the classic steak and fries. The fries were very thin and crisp, almost like fry chips. I enjoyed these a lot. I ordered my steak medium, but it wasn't pink at all. However, still tender. The steak, in my opinion, was just okay. I would not pay $25 for it again. \\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the patty melt. He likes almost everything in the world, but did not enjoy this meal at all. The party melt came with a thousand island dressing, which he hates. I can't recall if it said this on the menu....\\n\\nThe bread that they serve is just like in France. It was warm and crisp, even the butter was delicious.\\n\\nThe service was very good, our server's name was Katherin. Our waters were constantly being filled.\\n\\nI loved the environment. It was super windy today so we sat inside near a window, right by the bar.\\n\\nI would come back, but next time I would like to try breakfast.\",\n",

       " \"I really wanted to like this French bistro but it didn't live up to all the great Yelp reviews. Sometimes Yelp let's me down.\\n\\nWe arrived here for lunch without reservations. The hostess offered either an one hour wait for the outside seating or no wait for dining inside. It's a no brainer, we will dine inside to satisfy out cravings for some fine French cuisine. The highlight of MAG is the authentic French bistro setting. You feel like you are dining in the middle of Paris. \\n\\nThe service was just average at best. Our waiter was very nonchalant  and seem to be a little impatient when we asked questions about the menu. The lowlight of the MAG dining experience was when the server pretty much threw the creme brûlée on the table. Seriously, is this the stereotyped rude French attitude that is expected? I guess I got a taste of the real French experience in terms of service.\\n\\nI ordered the steak classique with maître d'hôtel butter sauce. I found the steak to be really dry and tough to chew. The herb butter sauce was good but it couldn't mask the very thinly dryed out piece of steak. However, I tried out a piece of the filet mignon with butter red wine reduction sauce and it was excellent. The wine reduction was amazing and the filet mignon was very tender as expected.\\n\\nOverall, the view from the patio is unbeatable sitting across the Bellagio fountains if you are willing to wait for it. But, the service and steak frites were disappointing. I'm willing to try their brunch menu next time when I come back to Vegas. Although, I'm incline to try out the competition, Bouchon.\",\n",

       " \"After all the raving my sister did about this place and with the ratings on Yelp, I expected more.  On our last night in Vegas we decided to have dinner here, of course I suggested this place.  With a party of 7 we had to wait for everyone to get to the restaurant in order to be seated.  The actual wait for a table after everyone showed up wasn't too bad.\\n\\nService was fine, however I kind of have to say that the wine the waitress recommended was not the bees knees.  \\n\\nMy date and I decided to share escargot, raw oysters and the pork tenderloin in caramelized onion sauce.  \\n\\nEveryone else ordered the steak, salmon and chicken breast.\\n\\nWe started off with the complimentary crusty baguette served with butter and slaw.  I was starving and the bread was quite tasty. \\n\\nThe escargot were fine, but a little lacking in flavor.  I actually prefer the escargot that they sell at Whole Foods for you to take home and bake.  Now THOSE are bombdiggity!  Oysters were pretty yummy and I wished for more, my date probably would have had ordered two orders of oysters and skipped the escargot.  \\n\\nPork tenderloin was a little small for the two of us to share, but thankfully I had filled up on the bread so it wasn't too bad.  The pork was a little dry and bland, but the sweet onion sauce made up for it.  The dish came with a little sprinkling of greens that I ate all of and a tomato stuffed with a parmesan, bacon, herb mixture.  The tomato was okay, but once you cut into it, the parmesan mixture spilled out.  \\n\\nI got to try my sister's chicken breast that came with a salad and lemon.  It was a bit dry and bland as well.  :T  However, her date who ordered the salmon completely demolished his plate.  \\n\\nThe total bill for 7 people came out to be a little less than $300 minus the tip, which honestly isn't too shabby.  However, overall we weren't left blown away by the meal.  Would I come back?  Mmm, with all the dining options in Vegas I don't think this would be my first choice where I just HAAAAAVE to go.\",\n",

Someone at the front doesn\\'t know how to use their computer.  \\n\\nWe were seated next to the atrium along the right side (facing the street). Our server (brunette, middle aged woman with bangs) came by to take our order and I asked how big the half serving of mussels were: she said 8 pieces. I\\'ve never heard of such a small serving before and I assumed they must be big. I said I\\'ll take the full one and she said \"it\\'s 16 pieces\". When it came out the mussels were tiny and there were way more than \"16\". They were forgettable. She ignored us the rest of the evening but was attentive to the table of 4 next to us, taking time to explain the dishes that were brought to their table. Great, I didn\\'t feel any discrimination at all. /sarcasm\\n\\nOur young busboy, however, was a true gem and the only saving grace of this place. He came by constantly to refill our waters and replied \"yes, ma\\'am\" when I said thank you. Our server even just stacked all the dishes on this poor boy and told him to finish clearing our table but personally cleared the table next to us. When we were leaving, he even said \"thank you, happy new year\". \\n\\nI should\\'ve gotten his name, but management needs to promote that guy because he will bring customers back and knows what service is about.

The prices are reasonable and we have a particular bottle of Rhone Wine that we always get.

Here's where the luck came in: most people sit on the patio so they can enjoy the gorgeous Bellagio fountain show during dinner. Our table, while inside, gave us the PERFECT view of the fountains and was very close to the outside patio. So throughout the whole dinner we got to enjoy the magnificent Bellagio fountain show on a beautiful summer night. My boyfriend ordered steak which was pretty good, and I ordered the fish which was okay.

We got seated at the open door way so we get the AC, coverage from the sun & gusts, and gorgeous views of the fountain show!  Totally \\'WINNING\" status!',\n",

       " \"This is one of my strip favorites.  I've had the pleasure of lunch and dinner and each experience has been delightful.  I enjoy the Hanger steak in the late afternoon...I recommend to go during the 4 o'clock hour or so in the spring season best to wait for patio seating since it is directly across The Bellagio fountain show.  Moreover, the hanger steak is excellent with a side of frites and also paired with nice bodied red wine preferrably a pinot noir.  Don't forget the chicken liver pate prior to the main course!  Also don't hesitate to sit and dine for at least a couple hours, enjoy the scenery and sip on wine. Enjoy!\",\n",
       " \"I may not been to Paris yet, but dining at Mon Ami Gabi on a lovely night was close enough. Situated with a front row view to Bally's famous water show across the street, my friends and I treated ourselves to a night of great food and company before heading over to the club. \\n\\nWe made reservations and were seated promptly outside after we requested for a patio table. The atmosphere was lively and bustling and the water show coming on every 15 minutes gave the restaurant a romantic ambiance. Service could not have been better, as our waiter was extremely kind and accommodating enough to run down to grab band-aids for some of us girls who had gotten blisters a little early from our evil high heels. \\n\\nFor starters, I just had to have the famous French onion soup. I haven't been able to find the perfect French onion soup for a while now, so trying it at an authentic French restaurant seemed like the right place. It came served in a generously deep bowl with plenty of melted cheese brimming on top. Sweet and savory with slivers of caramelized onions and cheese in every sip, I just had to share this with my girl friends. They all had plenty of fun dipping our complimentary bread in the soup. \\n\\nFor my entree, I'm actually not a huge steak fan so I didn't end up getting the steak, which is what this restaurant is famous for. And I'm sad to say that I slightly regret it. I had the Caramelized Sea Scallops and while they were scrumptious, I have to say that five pieces of medium sized scallops just wasn't enough. It came with some sugar snap peas and carrots on the side but it would have been nice if it came with either another side or a larger portion to round it off. \\n\\nThe frites (fries) were amazing though, and I would've ordered any of the Steak Frites dishes just to have these. Now if you're familiar with In-n-Out, you know those tiny, crispy slivers of potatoes that are too small to be considered actual fries that happen to taste like potato chips? Try having your entire portion of fries exactly like this! Now that is a dream come true. \\n\\nA great alternative for good eating if you don't feel like overstuffing your face at the many buffets on the strip, Mon Ami Gabi is the place to go.\",\n",

Other complaint is it use to come with hash browns as a side and instead they all come with a few cherry tomatoes now. You can order side of hash browns for $5-6. Not supportive of that change.',\n",
       " \"LOVED LOVED LOVED the food, great service, but...\\nYou've gotta go at night and sit outside so you can see the Bellagio Watershow while eating but this is Vegas so even at 10pm it's still 90 degrees and kinda hard to enjoy their delicious steak in the heat.  I could never imagine eating on the patio for lunch but maybe a quick drink in the afternoon would be alright.  They do have indoor seating but what makes this expensive meal worth it is the view of the strip, so go late, hope it's a cool night, enjoy the view and LOVE your steak.\",\n",

       " \"Upon entering Mon Ami Gabi, there were two lines - one with reservations and one without reservations. The hostess gave us the option to sit inside or outside. I liked how the restaurant had tall ceiling and big chandeliers. Despite the two building alarms that went off during our dinner before the Jersey Boys show, the food was excellent. After sitting down for 10-15 minutes, there was a confusion who was our server since no one came to our table. \\n\\nAfter we ordered, our server brought us a white paper bag with a warm baguette and a dish of butter. \\n\\nGuest #1 ordered a Lentil Soup and Endive and Blue Cheese Salad. The Lentil Soup (Soup of the Day) consisted of lentil and herb purée.  The Endive and Blue Cheese Salad consisted of endive, greens, blue cheese, warm bartlett pears, and toasted walnuts.\\n\\nGuest #2 ordered an Onion Soup Au Gratin and Trout Amandine. The French Onion soup consisted of beef broth with onions, bread, and melted gruyere cheese served in a bowl over a dish with a paper dolly on it. The Trout Amandine consisted of a pan seared, crispy trout topped with brown butter and almonds. It was served with steamed green beans and a preserved lemon. He was surprised there was no additional sauce.    \\n\\nGuest #3 ordered the Grilled Salmon and Spinach Salad which consisted of spinach, diced avocado, sun dried cranberries, and walnuts tossed in a citrus dressing.\\n\\nGuest #4 ordered Caramelized Sea Scallops which consisted of 4 tender, chewy, possibly a little rare sea scallops caramelized in maple syrup. It was served with broiled crispy brussels sprouts served over butternut squash purée.\\n\\nGuest #5 was quite adventurous when he was game for the Skate Wing. For those of you that don't know what a Skate Wing is, it's a fish belonging to the stingray family. It came with caper lemon spaetzle, roasted cauliflower and brown butter. It was the most delicious dish of the night.\\n\\nWe finished our meal with a Creme Brûlée and a Caramelized Pineapple Crepe. The Creme Brûlée was a vanilla flavored egg custard with a caramelized sugar coat. The Caramelized Pineapple Crepe was a warm crepe with coconut cream on the inside. It was topped with caramelized pineapple  \\nand drizzled with caramel sauce.\",\n",

Some patrons loved it but others commented the steak quality could be improved. Maybe. We didn't order the steak. What we did order we'll remember.\\n\\nChicken liver pate. Large caper berries, gherkins, pearl onions and a lovely mustard complemented the pate. Plated with pea tendrils and baguette toast. *****\\n\\nScallop appetizer in a blended veloute with fennel. My friends dish. She enjoyed it so much, she didn't even speak while devouring. \\n\\nDuck a'la Orange. The VERY BEST rendition I've yet to find. Such care was taken in the preparation it must have been some chef's best day. The skin, and you know how often it will arrive with a fat pocket, had the consistency of chiccarrones (is that spelled correctly?) A snack many friends enjoy but I've never found it enticing. This duck skin snapped and cracked, but underneath? Flavorful, moist. Two hind quarters (a large portion,) atop the sauce a'la orange, allowing me to enjoy the duck on it's own. Scallop potatoes aside-really good too!  *****\\n\\nProfiteroles for dessert. Three choux paste (?) pastries split, stuffed with vanilla ice cream, and penned with a chocolate sauce.  ****\\n\\nWide selection of wine, champagnes by the glass. Reasonable at $10-$14. St Pauli Girl NA $7. \\nMake a reservation for more dedicated service. Or at least think about it. So many visitors just walk-in a chef faces the frustration of turning out incredibly delicate sauces in haste. We really were treated to over-the-top meal and service-because we were expected.\",\n",

Mix of healthy options --- egg white omelettes and fruits, as well as more decadent ones like egg benedicts and big, fresh muffins.  Service was great, food and coffee was good and portions are massive enough to share.  Snag a table on the heated patio for great people and Bellagio fountain watching action - as well as an experience that truly makes you feel like you are seated in a nice French bistro.  \\n\\nOnly things that keep this place from another star is that even though it is part of the Paris hotel - it is somehow independent - so purchases don't count towards your travel rewards.  The chicken sausage - while it may be healthier doesn't taste very good - so avoid that one. And like seemingly almost all the places on the strip they only serve Pepsi (no Coke) products... what's up with that???\",\n",

Our waitress was easy to chat with, very knowledgeable about the menu, and answered even our silly questions about the humongous wine bottles decorating the restaurant. She was very on top of everything, checking periodically to make sure everything was to our liking while my friends and I dined.\\n\\nBetween all 4 of us, we ordered the BLT sandwich, seafood crepe, chicken crepe, and the sandwich of the day - lamb burger stuffed with roquefort cheese. The 2 sandwiches came with waffle fries and regular fries respectively. However, their fries are very different, as they are cut super super thin, so it's like eating potato chips instead of french fries. I loved this, but my friend was not quite as fond of it. We all liked our main dish though, so that was alright =). My lamb burger was juicy and oh-so-delish. The roquefort was just such yummy goodness and a perfect complement to the lamb, which was cook to a perfect medium-rare just as I requested. I can't tell you how happy that makes me when a restaurant can fulfill such a simple request such as this. You would think the request is simple but you will be amazed how many places always get it wrong.\\n\\nThe ambiance is very relaxing and chic, posh without being pretentious.

I think this was one of those places where I had to give them my credit card number to get a reservation, it's pretty serious haha! \\n\\nFood: I've had better French food in Seattle but I'm giving this place four stars for the experience. We all liked it very much, and despite everyone's different palettes, we were pleased with our dishes. I had the scallops, they were perfectly seared. The butternut squash was savory and complimented the scallops. It was around $25 for the dish, I thought it was fair. I also tried the escargot appetizer. I thought it was too oily, the snails were served in a pan with little circular slots. I think they were drizzled with a little bit of herb oil. I wouldn't order this again, but you can be the judge. The oil just made the snails unappealing, I've had escargot before but served in an actual sauce. I think that's a better way to cook them! \\n\\nPortions were generous. My friend ordered a salad and it was ginormous. All of us could have shared it, it looked good! My other friend ordered a sandwich and it came with a mountain of fries.

This was an anniversary dinner for my wife and I and we were looking forward to a nice evening. \\n\\nFirst, I called in our reservation and noted it was our anniversary, but when we arrived (after waiting in the 'reservation' line for about 45 minutes) the hostess could not find our reservation. Not a big deal right? I told them I made the reservation over the phone. They told me no problem they would seat me in just a few minutes. They ended up seating us at the worst table of the house, right behind the hostess stand. That wouldn't do for our anniversary dinner so I asked why we had such a poor table? The hostess replied that since we did not have a reservation, walk-ins get seated in the bar lobby. I reiterated that we did make the reservation, but that they somehow lost it. The hostess's reply? 'Well, I didn't lose your reservation.' I asked to speak to the manager.\\n\\nSecond, the manager comes up to the hostess stand. After a minute or two of whispers and checking their computer, she comes up to me and says, word for word 'And you are here for?' Seriously? As a manager THAT'S how you begin your interaction with a guest? I explained that what I was there for was for our anniversary, I made the reservation over the phone and I was not happy with the table they offered me. She responded by saying that they were very busy and that all walk-ins are sat in the bar area since there were no other available tables. After explaining, again, that we had made the reservation over the phone, the manager gave me a quick nod and said something to the hostess. No apology, not even a word of acknowledgement. The hostess sat us at a table in the solarium area.\\n\\nThird, the food is nothing special. There are plenty of other restaurants in Las Vegas that have better steaks and seafood. Eiffel Tower restaurant, Prime Steakhouse, Seablue, and Picasso just to name a few. I'm not saying the food was bad, but nothing to go out of your way for.\\n\\nOverall, if it wasn't for the horrible experience with the hostess and management (our waitress was actually very nice), we wouldn't have been impressed with this restaurant at all. Spend your time and money someplace else.\",\n",

Within minutes, I grabbed it and began my wonderful evening of drinking Whiskey, eating an excellent Steak Frites Plate (French style Steak and Fries) and savoring a Banana Foster's Crepe........while daydreaming and checking out the beautiful Bellagio Fountain Show (5 times) and enjoying the cool people watching on the Amazing Strip.\\n\\nThis was one of most entertaining afternoons on the Strip.

We had omelettes (spinach and goat cheese and mushroom and brie yum!) which came with hashbrowns (not potatoes, which was a little disappointing) and amazing bread with jelly on the side.  I also needed to try their homemade english muffin which was outstanding.  They also had a make your own bloody mary bar.  I'm not a fan of vodka at 10 am but it looked like it had a lot of great additions to your typical bloody mary!\\nThe reason I didn't want to give 5 stars is the the service was not so hot.  We had to wait and flag down our rotating waiters quite a few times and one of them was not very knowledgable about the menu.  \\nOverall would definitely return for breakfast here the next time I'm in Vegas.

They do fine all by their lonesome!\\nPrices aren\\'t too god awful like the rest of the strip...

       " '4.5 Stars\\n\\nWe took a spontaneous trip to Las Vegas Thanksgiving morning and ended up hungry inside Paris and found Mon Ami Gabi as we were walking out of the hotel. Being dinner time and being hungry a steakhouse sounded perfect so we decided to eat here. At first I was a little put off by the size of the place because this place was GIANT!!! Experience has taught me a big restaurant does not equal good food, but after passing by a few peoples tables my mind was quickly changing. We decided sit outside as the evening was gorgeous. The view we had was AWESOME!!! We sat along the strip with a view of the Bellagio. The Bellagio fountains provided an amazing show that was most enjoyable during our dinner. We were sitting on the inside patio, maybe ten feet from the street, and only heard 1 police car while we were sitting there. It was very quiet considering a heavy flow of traffic going down the Blvd. Just more of the magic of Las Vegas I suppose but we were very comfortable out there.\\n\\nI had the Filet Mignon with garlic spinach, my fiancee had the steak bordelaise with mashed potatoes. We had escargot as an appetizer, just because we were in Las Vegas. Not having any experience with escargot, I wasnt sure what to expect, certainly the emerald green color was a surprise. They were heavy on the butter and garlic which is always a good thing!!! The texture was similar tender calamari and reminded me of a seafood dish.\\n\\nMy fiancees steak was delicious as was mine. They were cooked to perfection and melted in our mouth. Our only MINOR gripe was the potatoes were a bit bland, no big deal. The rest of the food was so flavorful its probably the only reason we noticed. Our waiter was prompt and courteous as was his assistant. We had a great time Mon Ami Gabi!',\n",
       " 'My friend and I came here after watching an evening show. We were able to be seated right away. We shared the frisée salad and bone in ribeye. And our server made a wonderful recommendation for a glass of beaurdoux superior.',\n",

As the restaurant is directly across from the fountains, it is also a great place to dine while taking in the free show.   The food fits the setting, with a traditional French menu infused with a bit of Vegas penache.   We had excellent service..polite, prompt, helpful (great at helping us pick a great wine suited to our selections!) and personal.

I got the braised pork banh mi and my husband got the scallops.

The prices were reasonable considering the location and quality. I would definitely come here again.',\n",

We had GF eggs Benedict with smoked salmon served on chick pea patties, gf blueberry french toast topped with blueberries and, a perfect cup of coffee.

You might pluck down $200 for a couple and have the worst food of your life, or $40 and remember the delicacy you ate forever. In that respect Mon Ami Gabi did not disappoint.\\n\\nWe went early, like 7pm, because we had a show at 9pm at the Rio, a bit far from the Paris. It was hot and sunny, so we requested to be seated inside. We had reservations, and got seated immediately.\\n\\nOur waiter (Stephanie) showed up immediately and instead of starting with the standard script, she made us feel at home, like we just walked into a family owned café in Strasbourg. Really, she was all smiles, friendly and relaxed, no rush. We asked a bunch o questions and she responded perfectly, she never made us feel rushed and no question was too stupid. After her detailed descriptions we knew exactly what we wanted.\\n\\nAt first we got a complimentary baguette with butter to get us going, it was excellent.\\n\\nWe ordered dishes that we normally have a hard time getting in our own side of the planet. The steak au Poivre with Pommes Puree and the Trout Almondine. Both were excellent, highly recommended. How do you say \"Oh là là\" in English?\\n\\nWe also ordered a side of Ratatouille, which we never had before, so I can\\'t tell if it was a \"good ratatouille\", we liked it but nothing special, we probably will not order this again. Yep, the Disney movie was a great influence here (fyi: ours didn\\'t look at all like the one prepared by Remy for the grumpy food critic Anton Ego).\\n\\nTo finish our adventure, we ordered the Chocolate Mousse, also very good. Does life have a meaning without Chocolate Mousse?\\n\\nIn summary, our overall experience at Mon Ami Gabi was excellent, and kudos for Stephanie, she\\'s she type of waiter that I would like to have at all restaurants I go to. Vegas has a lot to learn from her.\\n\\nCheers!',\n",

So when it came to choosing a fairly priced lunch spot, my sister and I relied on one of those tourist guides found on hotel info kiosks.  We didn\\'t want to do the usual food court joints so we were happy to read in a booklet... a $$ Frenchy cafe with outdoor seating and a view of the Bellagio fountains.  Yes, that is the one!\\n\\nWe were seated quite promptly during peak lunch hour and fairly center for a great outdoor view.  Service was prompt and very attentive.  My Pinot Gris needed a bit more time to chill, but otherwise it was a nice brunchy buzz.  My sis\\'s Bellini seemed to have given her a nice punch too as she got light headed after 2 sips.  ;)  Which called for immediate noshing on our warm baguette and butter.\\n\\nWe got the Chicken Liver Mousse Pate w/ red wine mustard.  It came with toasted baguettes, pearl onions, and those baby pickles.  All were great accompaniments to the rich, savory pate.  I really liked that sweet n sour condiments with the livery taste.  \\n\\nMy bacon quiche was extremely smooth and cheesy.   The crust was perfectly flaky too.  I cant stand a dense, dried out quiche with some basic ham... this simple dish was definitely prepared with care.  Sis had the shrimp and scallops crepe.  Also delish!  Seafood was not overcooked like it could have easily have been..  The cream sauce was very flavorful and the crepe worked great to soak it all up.  Portions were generous so we were nice and full. \\n\\nAmbiance is great here... sure it isn\\'t the exact feeling of a real French cafe... what with fat tourists with those outrageous 2 feet long Long Island Ice tea drinks walking by staring at us.  But the service here makes a good effort in making you feel at ease so you ignore the noontime drunkards and Celine Dion\\'s \"My Heart Will Go On\" choreographed to 10 story high water squirts.  \\n\\nSo now I know where to dine in Vegas... Wynn Buffet, Bellagio Buffet, Rio Buffet, and here.',\n",

First of all, I walked in and stood at the counter for almost 5 minutes before any of the 4 or 5 hostesses even looked up to acknowledge me. That is incredibly rude. \\nI ordered the French onion soup expecting amazing flavor  since it's #1 on yelp and it was good, but certainly shouldn't be known as the best in Vegas. I also tried the Cubano sandwich. That was good. Great flavors. I ordered the Macaroni gratin for my daughter. Horrible. How do you mess up mac and cheese? Absolutely no flavor whatsoever. Incredibly bland. With the amount of money being spent there I expect delicious food and great service. Incredibly disappointed with today's experience.\",\n",

It was a Saturday night, and we were sat by a lovely, romantic window within seconds.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was incredible.... across from the Bellagio Water Show, and next to a window in a romantically lit restaurant that had a wonderful aesthetic... tiled floors (slippery in heels), lovely deep wooden grain finish on the classic bar.  It was as close to a dimly lit French bistro as you might find out of France.\\n\\nThe food was awesome.... \\n\\nThe oysters had one of the best mignonette\\'s I have ever had.  For Las Vegas, oyster country (sarcasm button on), they were fresh and shucked decently.  Luckily, nothing like Andy K.\\n\\nThe Endive and Blue Cheese salad with watercress and roasted pear was sublime.  The French Onion soup was great.  Again, I don\\'t like it sweeter than smoky or \"zesty\"... but it was great.\\n\\nThe Salade Maison was very good, but the presentation of the goat cheese and croutons being the piece of toast with cheese spread ontop of it was confusing... in that Lauren ate that without realizing that was the \"goat cheese & croutons\" inherent to the salad.\\n\\nThe French Martini was great (grey goose with pineapple, champagne, and chambord....)\\n\\nThe French 75 was perfect.  I subbed beefeater for the sapphire, and it was just awesome.  AWESOME!\\n\\nBut being on the strip, even a casual, non reservation type of meal... the bill came to $140 or something.  1 app, 2 salads, 4 cocktails, one soup.... $140.\\n\\nI know it is demanding to ask Vegas to be cheap, but to sit for a couple apps and salads and see a bill like that is just... disheartening.\\n\\nSo... go to Vegas with money.  PLEASE PLEASE shove cost out of your head prior to sitting down ANYWHERE.\\n\\nBecause Vegas is pricey.  Check out my Las Vegas as to why.... but it isn\\'t just expensive.  I work in fine dining and high end hotels, and the price point is at least 20%-35% over a normal meal.  \\n\\nAs long as you recognize that, even a casual, spur of the moment meal can be magical, romantic, delicious, and stunning.\\n\\nI would go back here in a second, with the awareness I wish I had previously had.

I always sit outside where you have an incredible view of the Bellagio fountains while you dine. Perfect for simple wine and appetizers or for a whole meal. They have great heaters cranking in the winter, so you can still comfortably enjoy being on the patio. If there is one thing I would tell everyone to do, it is sit outside and sip a glass of wine. You will not regret it!\\n\\nWhile the view sells it for me, the food and service are pretty great as well. For Vegas, the prices are pretty reasonable. In the past I've done the French Onion Soup and a side salad, which have been perfect. The Goat Cheese appetizer is warm and satisfying, great to snack on with a glass of wine. \\n\\nI landed in Vegas 2 nights ago, and my friend's flight was delayed coming in, so I was on my own for dinner. I immediately knew I would go to Mon Ami Gabi. I bundled up in my winter coat and walked over. I asked for a table outside and was very comfortable under one of the many, many heaters they have out there. My server was incredibly helpful with the wine list as my knowledge of French wine is limited, and I loved what he picked for me. You are immediately presented with a loaf of bread and butter, as well as an amuse buche. Tonight is was green apple and fennel with a mayonnaise dressing (the French really do love their mayo). It was a lovely snack while I debated what I wanted. When the waiter came back, I could not make a decision. I mentioned wanting to try the steak tartare as it is something I've somehow never had, and he said that it was his favorite thing on the menu and I must get it. Not wanting to drop $35 and also not being that hungry, he offered to have them make me a half order as an appetizer and charge half the price. Sold!\\n\\nIt was really delicious, and I am so glad I listened to him. Plus, with the smaller portion and price point, I had room for dessert! Again torn between a few options, I went with his recommendation of the bananas foster crepe. Delicious only begins to explain how good it was. The caramel sauce was decadent and the crepe was light and fluffy. I spent about an hour and a half there, slowly sipping my wine and reading my book while I ate, pausing every 20 minutes or so to watch the amazing fountains across the street (and the people watching isn't bad either :). My server would occasionally stop to check on me, often engaging in some lovely conversation and never making me feel like I should hurry up and leave. \\n\\nA trip to Vegas should always begin with a night on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi!\",\n",

My wife and daughter shared and enjoyed the Crispy Duck Confit with braised red cabbage, sun-dried cherries, calvados glaze and Mussels Marinière\\nwith white wine & herbs, and my two sons shared the filet mignon steak bone in and Onion Soup au Gratin, the French classic baked with gruyère cheese.  Everything was first rate, the food, the wait staff, the setting near the patio yet inside where it was still cool.  \\n\\nOverall, a much better experience than Hell's Kitchen.\",\n",
       " 'If you are expecting small portion sizes like most French restaurants Mon Ami Gabi has excellent portion sizes. The service was above average for a Las Vegas strip property. The only downfall with this restaurant is that the seating is very over crowded. You are seated one on top of the other. We dined on a Saturday night and it was very busy, which is to be expected for a restaurant perched on Las Vegas boulevard. It seem as though the restaurant was focused on \"turning and burning\" tables. Average dinning time for other French bistros is a lot longer. We had a party of 4 and with appetizers and dinner we were out in less then an hour. Good if you want to get in a meal before a show. \\nThe service was outstanding. Although the restaurant in my opinion was focussed on room turnover our waiter still took the time to help walk is through the menu. Overall good experience just really busy and very noisy.',\n",

The best potatoes I've had and I love potatoes. Heck, I might just order breakfast potatoes next week (I'm kidding only.... or am I?). Steak frites are also good (that's what my boyfriend ordered). \\n\\nDefinitely would recommend eating here. Mon Ami Gabi is my favorite restaurant for brunch in Sin City.

A coworker had recommended it to me - saying it was the best eggs Benedict she'd ever had - so obviously I had to check it out!\\n\\nI called around 9AM to make a reservation for 10:30 AM, and they were able to accommodate us easily.  That was already a good sign - no waiting, and we didn't have to make the reservation days ahead of time.\\n\\nBreakfast is served until 11AM, so I ordered a croissant sandwich (egg, avocado, turkey and mayo).  And like the french-fry addict that I am, I had to try the pomme frites!  Little did I know, the croissant sandwich would be HUGE (they were generous with the eggs!) and I would hardly be able to finish half of it.  The croissant was SO GOOD!  It was crispy, buttery, and flaky.  Just how I'd want a croissant to be!  It was definitely the best part of the dish.  The frites were also wonderful - really skinny, crispy, and flavorful.  Wish I had more room in my stomach to finish them!\\n\\nWe also ordered the egg white omelette - which we thought was a little odd.  It looked like a crepe made of eggs, filled with turkey and topped with avocados.  It wasn't bad, but it was a strange consistency for eggs.\\n\\nThe nutella hazelnut waffle - AMAZING.  A must-order.  It's crispy on the outside, filled with nutella on the inside, and comes with fresh whipped cream.  I could have eaten the whipped cream with a spoon!\\n\\nOverall everything was good, and I'd definitely come back here.  Unfortunately it was a rainy day in Vegas, so we were sitting inside, but I'm sure it'd be lovely to have an outdoor patio seat next time.\",\n",

Came here on a Friday at around 11:30AM during the 4th of July weekend and surprisingly the place was not packed so we got seated right away.\\n\\nAmbience - 4/5 stars. Restaurant is located at the Paris hotel. They offer the option of sitting at the balcony area with a nice view of the strip. However, it was hot so we sat in the foyer-ish area which had a very lovely feel with a lot of natural light hitting in all directions. You could also opt to sit inside which was more dimly lit.\\n\\nService - 3/5 stars. They were very accommodating with where we wanted to sit so that was nice. However, it wasn't as attentive as I perceived this restaurant to be. Steak knifes weren't given with our orders and server forgot to bring coffee menu when asked for one.\\n\\nFood- 2/5 stars. My boyfriend ordered the prime steak sandwich and I ordered the merlot steak frites. Both served medium. The steak was ok. The Merlot sauce was pretty good but I personally didn't care for how the fries were served because they tasted like potato chips and I like my fries to be crispy and fluffy. Also, the food was cold when they came to our table. COLD! That def made our dining experience not a happy one! \\n\\nOverall, the restaurant is just ok. It's got a nice ambience but the lunch food was mediocre for what you're paying for. Can't attest to the brunch menu but I don't think I'd be making the effort to come back just to try that.\",\n",

It's usually got lots of marbling and good flavor from being near the bone.\\n\\nMon Ami Gabi served what might have been the worst bone-in ribeye I've had.  It was cooked medium rare, but it was chewy, not juicy, and not really that flavorful (even w/ the super bland bearnaise sauce).  You know it's a bad meal when I think it's not even worth my company's dime (thank you, business trips, for saving me the pain of spending my own money).  I would probably still be disappointed even if I paid half the price.\",\n",

       " \"Consensus is that Mon Ami Gabi is the best brunch spot in Las Vegas. Located right on the strip, the expectations were set high. And a New York brunch palette is easy to displease. \\n\\nDrinks\\nGabi didn't disappoint. The Frangria (the French Sangria) was one of I believe two drinks that came in pitcher sizes, and was adequately sized and quite quenching. \\n\\nAppetizers\\nWe ordered Escargot (buttery snails) and the Baked Goat Cheese to start. While the Escargot is always a fun dish - new to some, icky to most, but uniformly just tastes like buttery mushrooms. It's not the restaurants fault - the dish is more of a conversation starter than food. The goat cheese and garlic bread, on the other hand, was pure BLISS. I'm not sure how something so simple tastes so magical. Perhaps we were hungry. We devoured the dish in minutes and were debating cancelling some entrees to get more. 10/10 would recommend!\\n\\nEntrees\\nI personally love quiche Lorraine and was unfortunately very disappointed with the dish. Thats the reason I'm taking a star off. Not much to say - it was dismal and unappetizing. The crust wasn't crunchy, the insides felt try and rubbery. A disaster.\\nA friend got the French toast, which came with blueberries on top. A standard dish that was as expected.\\nAnother buddy was and has been on a life long quest for maximum fitness and decided he'd only let a fruit salad accentuate his otherwise soylent diet. And this is Vegas we're talking about. Ugh.\\nThe eggs Benedict is a brunch classic. I'd say New York had definitely treated us to better, but all in all not bad. The yolk flowed, but the bread wasnt crispy. Two people got this and were fairly pleased.\\n\\nOverall\\nThe place is expensive some entrees ranging to the $25-30 range. It's clearly a $$$ place, and expectations are pretty high at that point. If this were in New York, I'd give it a 3 star, but because good dining is rather rare in Vegas (from the few places we went to), and because the goat cheese was some ambrosia-ass shit, 4 stars is it.\",\n",

First visit I had French onion soup (one of the best I've had), baked goat cheese (delicious, served in dish with warm marinara, garlic bread for dipping), and steamed artichoke (warm, tender leaves, very tasty). The last time I went with goat cheese dish and steamed artichoke. Goat cheese was as good as I remembered, but the artichoke was served right out of the fridge (cold to touch, tough leaves). Waiter apologized and took it off the bill. My recommendation, don't order the artichoke for lunch. They are reheating (If they remember) last night's artichokes.\",\n",

I had such high hopes going to this place for dinner with my husband and in-laws; maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but for such a well reviewed restaurant and at the prices they charge, I expected consistency and was left disappointed. Some of the things they did well (dessert!) was very good, but not enough to outweigh the bad. \\n\\nThe opening bread was warm, crusty and lovely. This was accompanied by quite a downer of a carrot salad - typically served with herbs and doused with olive oil and lemon, it should be refreshing, but ours was bland and tasteless (maybe they forgot the salt or lemon juice?). Then followed onion soup, which was filling and quite good, with a nice layer of melty cheese on top and a sweet and salty, if a bit too salty, soup base. \\n\\nI tried a small bit of my husband's rib eye, which was well flavored and tasty, but not, I felt, exceptional nor did it warrant its price of $40, although in retrospect, maybe I should have gone with a steak of some kind. Maybe I made a mistake ordering the mussels mariniere w/ frites (full order) at a steakhouse - but it's a French steakhouse! And mussels mariniere is so classically French! The mussels were slightly gritty and clearly not very fresh, the sauce tasted like mostly cream and butter without any scent or taste of the delicate spices and herbs that usually accompanies it, and the fries were stale and slightly cold. This was incredibly disappointing for me.\\n\\nWe ended dinner with an excellent bananas foster crepe with caramel sauce, with vanilla ice cream. This was the highlight of the dinner; the caramel sauce was deep and rich, and who can resist that incredible juxtaposition of cold ice cream melting into warm caramelized sugar? I know I can't. \\n\\nOn the plus side, the service was friendly and efficient. Since it was raining, we were seated in the atrium instead of the sidewalk patio, which still afforded a view of the Bellagio fountains. When our server found out my concerns about the mussels, he relayed it to the chef, who comped us the dessert, which I appreciate, but ultimately, I don't think I'd come back, especially when there are so many other places to eat on the strip!\",\n",

The chef did a great job of cooking mine medium rare. As an appetizer the baked goat cheese with tomato sauce was great to share. Unfortunately, when I ordered the mussels a lot of them were cracked and I was getting shells in my mouth. However, this probably not always the case.

Service lacked, the 3 servers were in earshot as they tried to pass our table among themselves, really?... You're like 3 ft away from me and you're at work. Food wasn't that great, although our apps were yummy smoked salmon and pate, entrees were covered in sauce and bland, after half of my meal I felt a little sick of it. I knew I should have just gotten the soup, oh well. I'll skip this place next time.\",\n",

We walked a half mile from our hotel for the real corn beef hash which my husband loves and it did not disappoint. Two eggs toast, hash and blistered tomatoes plus we had tea and coffee. Service was very good we sat on the patio great view if you like to people watch (which we do). Great breakfast for our first day in Vegas!',\n",

Both were excellent. \\nThe atmosphere is great here, the service is very good, and the food is generally very good.  It's consistent from visit to visit so we always look forward to coming back, and always recommend Mon Ami Gabi.\",\n",

Started with a nice glass of red wine and they brought out warm bread and a carrot salad.  Normally I'm not find of carrots but this changed my mind, it was great in the bread.\\n\\nI ordered the salmon and it was one of the best cooked pieces of salmon I have had.  Many places overcook the salmon but this was done just right. \\n\\nThe menu had a good mix of steaks, fish, and chicken offerings so there should be something for everybody.

Same goes for the french toast. \\nI've had their steak in the past and i have to say judging solely by this experience, their dinner is way better than their breakfast. \\nRegardless this place is a def must out here and i will comeback and try something different. \\nParking is in back of the casino or any casino for that matter and cost is $9. \\nThis post has left me hungryyy!!\",\n",

One was his friendly service and beer suggestions. The other...\\n\\nThe highlight or (horror of the night for me) happened a few moments into our meal. I f***ed up and spilled my friends ENTIRE BEER all over his plate of food, shirt, and pants. His plate went from a pasta to a soup.

I personally loved my steak au poivre, my boyfriend's brother loved his steak bordelaise, and my boyfriend's dad got the ribeye. The portions and quality of food are worth the price. Definitely try one of the desserts - the warm chocolate cake was fabulous.\\n\\nService: The service was good, but if you need to be on time for a show (like the O at the Bellagio across the street), make sure to tell your server ASAP! I told the hostess as she walked us to the door, but I really should have also spoken with the server immediately. She took her time at first before we spoke to her about our tickets, but after that was absolutely perfect, getting the food out to us quickly, etc. Our water glasses were always full, and we got everything we wanted.\\n\\nLocation/Seating: We got a perfect table right at the edge of the patio. Unless it's super cold, definitely sit on the patio. There are heat lamps, you can people-watch, and you have front-row seating for the Bellagio fountain show.\\n\\nGETTING A TABLE:\\nOkay, here's the info I really need you to know: Just try everything. Try to get a reservation (indoors only), then show up 45-60 minutes before you actually want to eat and ask for an outdoor patio seat. You can also ask for an indoors table, but the ambiance wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary for a fancy restaurant.\\n\\nThe reason why this place is 4 stars instead of 5 is because of their ridiculous approach to tables. I wanted to eat at 5:30 to get to our 7:30 show at the Bellagio. No reservations except for 4:30 and 9:30 - I went with neither. So my boyfriend and I showed up an hour early and went to separate lines (???) for an indoor table vs. an outdoor table. He could get an outdoor table that could be ready around 5:30 (perfect) and I couldn't get anything until 9. I just got mad when we were escorted to our patio table and we passed by several empty tables that could have accommodated our party. That was frustrating and I could see how that wouldn't be great if the weather was terrible (unlikely) or if someone really needed to sit inside. I dunno, that just didn't make any sense.\",\n",

However, the boyfriend got the corned beef hash which is recommended on yelp, and that was delicious! So, lesson learned. Make sure you order the corned beef hash if you are here for breakfast/brunch!\\n\\nWe thought about ordering the steak frites but felt it was a bit too early for steak.

Had tasty mussels and took a trip or two to the Bloody Mary bar.  \\n\\nThere is a large patio and an atrium that is full of light on a sunny day.  \\n\\nFor a mid-priced meal that has exceptional quality, Mon Ami Gabi is a great choice.',\n",

We ended up waiting about 15 minutes and played some of the machines, why they don't have more seating for guests to wait is beyond me.\\n\\nWe were seated one row back from the edge of where the patio meets the strip, I asked if  we could sit at a table that was clearly open along the railing and the hostess moved us over there right away.\\n\\nOur sever, Emily, was PHENOMENAL.  One of the best servers I've encountered in Vegas.  She recommended a great seafood appetizer (mussels), a tasty brunch item (corned beef hash) and delicious mimosas.  All of the food was tasty!  My only con is that it did seem to take a bit longer than normal to finally receive out entrees, but the flavor made up for it!\\n\\nThe entire time we had a front row view to the Bellagio water fountain show just across the strip.  It was also a prime spot to people watch, which in Vegas it gets VERY interesting.  BE WARNED that on the patio it does get a bit warm sitting in the sun, even in October.  They do have umbrellas to provide shade, but as the sun moves you begin to have no control over the shade as there is really no room to move the umbrellas.\\n\\nAll in all my girlfriend and I had a great experience and we will be going back again in the future!\",\n",

I also enjoyed the onion soup, but I was not a huge fan of the baked cheese on top. \\nI ordered the eggs Benedict which came with Canadian bacon and a side of hash browns. I found the hash brown to be really cold when it came out, and the English muffin was extremely hard- I couldn't cut it so I just ended up eating the top part. It was just too burnt. \\nMy friends orders were delicious though! Especially the chicken sandwich- I will definitely order that if I were to come here again! It also comes with a side of fries, which were crispy and perfectly seasoned. \\nI also tried the grilled cheese and mushroom and chicken crepe. They were delicious and perfectly cooked.\\nOne downside is that after placing our order, we decided we wanted to try the fries and ordered it from our waiter. He failed to mention that the two of our dishes came with fries and we had no idea, so we had 3 fries for 4 people and it was way too much. \\nWe tried the creme brûlée for dessert and it was good!

The steak frites are long, thin sirloin cuts of meat and you choose a topping like blue cheese sauce.  It comes with Pom frites but you can choose any side. I would recommend the mushrooms even though the whipped cauliflower and garlic spinach were good also. The baked Brie drizzled with honey was AMAZING. It left me wanting to order 3 more! It was creamy and a little sweet: and so was the roasted garlic that came with it. Had to order the creme brûlée of course. I loved the burnt vanilla bean at the bottom. Last but not least, I found my new favorite cocktail here, the Paris Romance (Malibu, Disarrono, and fruit juices). I even had one the next morning for brunch at 10:45 am heehee.

I said it was my birthday and that we would have two people that are hard of hearing in our party and anywhere that was quieter would be great, maybe that was a ridiculous request but I don't think any of my requests were actually acknowledged that night. So with our two week advance reservation we arrived 30 minutes early and were told to wait, I had gleaned from other reviews that the seating times were a little delayed but we waited an extra 15 minutes on top of ours, so after shuffling through the crowd at the front, we are shown to our table and didn't have to walk far! It was 20 steps from the doorway and two steps from the bar and ordering system, so for my 27th birthday instead of a view of the Bellagio fountains I stared at a black floor mat and paper table covers! I was flabbergasted when we sat down and once I came to my senses I  asked the hostess if there were any other tables available not in the bar, she checked and said if we wanted to wait another 30mins there would be something then. Before you think I'm some disgruntled birthday girl, the table next to us, a husband and wife celebrating a birthday as well, were also dismayed to learn that their reservation meant a romantic view of the bartenders legs, they however had a better server and managed to get a better table, I guess we should have gone donner party on half of our group to get a worthy seating assignment.\\nSteak- the frites weren't anything special, the steak was tender but almost like it had been tenderized (Mom and Grandma both commented); the top layer had that mealy texture. This is coming from someone who eats steak like twice a year and was really looking forward to a good one. So to put insult to injury the steak I had consisted of a four inch section of sinew down the middle, you couldn't cut it! I told the waitress, which I never do, I am not a picky eater and never want to step on someone's toes ( bad haircut, no prob it'll grow out!) but tonight I had enough, she understood, took it away, brought out a new one, and comped it, which made up for the misery a little.\\n\\nSo on a whole this night was just so bad I had to write a review, I think I would have been happier with In-N-Out!\",\n",

Asked the chef to get it medium rare and i got pretty much a seared steak and It tasted TERRIBLE!!!! It was easily the worst steak I've ever had. Go somewhere else if you want a steak, believe me you can find a better one. And then they tried to save face by giving a free dessert, but at that point I just wanted to get out of there. And as a local Las Vegas restaurant I will be telling my friends to stay away for all events. and this is not the first time I've been here, I've been here previously and thought it was excellent.

       " 'Went to Gabi\\'s last Tuesday before leaving Las Vegas AND fellow Yelpers did not steer me wrong.  Excellent food and excellent service AND, AND AND... (very important for Vegas-on the Strip Restaurants... the prices were extremely fair for the quality of the food.  (Hey, Gabi management.... don\\'t start raising prices cause I said this!!! )  All I am saying is that if you go to some of the dumpy restaurants in some of the hotels, you pay through the nose for food that belongs inside a septic tank before its time.  For example, there is a restaurant in the Rio that wants 28 for a chicken pot pie.. really Rio? \\nHad the steak au poivre, trout, and croque monsieur.  One of my guests who had the steak told me it was soooooo delicious that if she were home she would be licking the plate until it no longer needed washing... (a beautiful image). The guest who had the trout said it was the best trout he ever had... and the croque monsiuer was excellent but a little on the greasy side because of all the butter and cheese.  I think Gabi\\'s can cut back a little on the butter since the delicious Gruyere cheese that it is made with provides most of the fat this sandwich needs.  I must share with you that I am a French Onion Soup aficionado.  I eat it here and in my favorite city in the whole wide world---Paris.  Well, I ordered the French Onion Soup at Gabi\\'s and it looked amazingly beautiful-- a tall crock of soup with melted Gruyere cheese perfectly broiled on top resulting in gorgeous spots of darkened Gruyere--yum.  However, then I tasted it.  It was reeking with sugar.  Yes sugar.  So sweet I couldn\\'t eat it.  When I beckoned the waiter to discuss it, he told me the onions caused the sweetness because they were sweet onions.  In response to the waiter\\'s answer, I am going to put on the voice of an irate waiter in Paris. (now use your imagination and think of a balding, older gentleman who has been on his feet for at least 7 hours dealing with American tourists)  They go deep into their throats before saying : \\'NOH! (that would be an American \"No\".)  I too say No to the theory that the onions caused the sweetness.  Do you know why?  Because I cook  that\\'s why!  I believe that this soup has been Americanized to address the palettes of some americans (I said SOME so don\\'t write back insulting me!).  They added sugar, lots of it AND because of the color of the soup,  I believe they added some Marsala wine which also provides some sweetness.  The ending of the French Onion Soup saga is that they graciously took it back.  They are a class act.  And did I forget about the service????   Amazing.  One of my guests had their water glass filled 7 times.  I\\'m not kidding.  AND, AND, And, did I forget to tell you about the Baguette????  Yes,  a complete baguette in a bakery bag--- delivered still warm from the oven presented with a generous portion of spreadable butter.  Yes spreadable --not those hard little bricks most restaurants serve.  And did I tell you we sat on the patio overlooking The Strip?  with misters to keep us cool???  Why did I leave thist to the end?.....  Because the food was the star of the show.   I am SOOOOOOO sorry that I went to Gabi\\'s on my last day in Vegas.... if I had been there the first day, I would have chained my leg to one of the tables on the patio and eaten there every day breakfast, lunch and dinner... I would allow someone to take me to the bathroom every few hours only if they promise to give me back my table upon my return.  Otherwise, I\\'ll skip the bathroom breaks.     Thanks Gabi management and staff for a wonderful experience and having a really great restaurant!',\n",

Biggest crepes we've ever seen and the best we've ever tasted by far. The lemon had a nice tart, sugary flavor and the apple tasted exactly like apple pie. The bacon was nice and thick but we definitely could've been full with just the crepes so we would skip any sides next time. We took our baguettes to go and ate them on the plane ride home so at least they didn't go to waste.

Anyways I ordered the hams and cheese crepe and I didn't like it so I returned it back to th kitchen and ordered the Cubano. Efrain seemed upset that I didn't like my dish. Which is really annoying cause it's not like I didn't order anything else. My cubano sandwich took a long time to come And my friends and I were in a rush so I asked him if he could hit box my food whenever it comes out.

It was comparable to those I had in Paris.\\n\\nFor the main course, I had salmon with terragon sauce on a bed of pureed peas, topped with arugula. This is one of the best salmon dishes I have ever had, very well done. It was flavorful, complex, and well-balanced. This was like Spring on a plate. I loved the fresh terragon cream sauce, it was zesty and refreshing. The salmon was cooked to perfection, slightly crackly and crispy on the outside, moist and tender inside. I have tried to replicate this a couple times at home unsuccessfully. Oh well, guess I will just have to come back here! \\n\\nFor dessert, I had a warm pear and rhubarb cobbler a la mode. It is possibly the best non-chocolate dessert I've ever had. In classic French style, they had poached the fruit in red wine, which gave it a wonderful flavor. Also, I like my desserts very sweet, and this cobbler hit the spot.\\n\\nAmbience: We chose to sit in the covered/indoor patio. It is beautifully French. Very classic bistro style. They also have a very French cafe-style outdoor patio overlooking the sidewalk.

Skip the country pate (bland) and the cheese plate was uninteresting and the slices quite small.

But even italian restaurants in Iowa give you some pepper and parm to add to the oil you're dipping it in.\\n\\nEscargots were bad.  Lacking flavor, under seasoned, and 17 bucks for 1.2 ounces of snail meat just isn't a good deal.  Only good thing is that once you ate the snails you could dip some of your leftover bread in the snail sauce and the bread absorbed enough of the flavor that it wasn't bad.  If this is the best they can do on snail meats they should honestly take them off the menu.  I could do better than this at home.  And I've never even seen a snail.\\n\\nScallops I had were okay but not great.  Tasted surprisingly fishy for scallops.  It wasn't necessarily a bad fishy taste, but wasn't something I was used to at a nice restaurant.  Seemed weird.\\n\\nMy gf ordered a steak and it was good but I thought this place was French.  It's not like they're gonna beat Craft or a dozen other places on steak.\\n\\nSides were pretty meh.  We had the rat one, plus pommes puree.  They're relatively cheap (6 bucks vs 11+ at some places) but they also weren't that great.  I guess they're rated okay, given the relatively low price.\\n\\nBottom line is I'd go elsewhere.

Now that I know, if I go again, i will ask for veggies or something else on the side...I just don't think it went well with the meat...or maybe if there were less of them and more of something else..,but hey..maybe that's how they do it in France!

You can pay more for a steak at many of the generic steakhouses inside casinos, and the wine by the glass is really very reasonable at 7 or 8 bucks per glass for their more basic wines (I had both a sauv blanc and a glass of gsm and both were good and recently opened). \\n\\nAs for the food:\\nI started with the sea scallops which were in a mussel cream sauce. Outstanding, though perhaps a touch too much Parmesan. That's not really a complaint though... just finding something to quibble about.\\n \\nI had their prime rib special which looking back on it was a mistake. The prime rib was fine though not outstanding and it was reasonable at 35 dollars. It was also too much food in the end when combined with my other dishes. \\n\\nThe others in my party had salmon (i didn't get the verdict), the new york strip (judged good and the shallots very good), the crab cakes (judged outstanding), the salmon salad (good), as well as the french and soup du jour (a apple and parsnip soup). \\n\\nFor dessert two of us had chocolate mousse. The mousse was exactly what you'd hope and expect. They topped it with dark chocolate crunchy things which are good, but unfortunately just put pink berry in mind for me because they have to be exactly the same thing. Another person had the peach parfait and was a fan of it. \\n\\n---\\nSo I'd give this 4 stars. The food was very good, but not truly exceptional, which I think it needs to be at this price range to earn a 5. The service was very good, refills on water came swiftly, and the pacing was appropriate for a French restaurant (i.e. slow, but purposefully and not annoyingly so). \\n\\nOf course, mention has to be made about the atmosphere. It's really nice. I asked for a table with a view of the Belaggio fountain, and they made us wait about 15 minutes upon arriving, but they gave us a good table for it. It was very pleasant. \\n\\nI'd definitely suggest this restaurant. I think you could probably get a better meal if you stepped up a price category somewhat, but then you wouldn't have the nice sidewalk cafe feel.\",\n",

When we finally are about to get seated the hostess offers us a able outside, then the hostess next to her tells her not to offer it to me (seriously). So she apologizes and says I can\\'t have it. Ok?! A guy walks up right behind me with his buzzer and offers him the table outside. Did that just happen?! Oh wait, it did....Possibly the worst first impression of any restaurant I\\'ve been to. If my best friend wasn\\'t so excite to eat here I for sure would have walked off.\\n\\nLets get to the food. I ordered the special. It was medallions wrapped with bacon. And to be fair the waitress said you could not request how you like the steak due to bacon having to be cooked a certain temperature.... My medallions were so over cooked they were like hard little poker chips... And were as chewy a beef jerky. Possibly the worst steak I\\'ve ever had. They were a dark brown color the ENTIRE way through. Gross.\\n\\nThe only good thing that happened during the entire meal was our server. #74. She was awesome! \\n\\nI considered ordering something other than steak, but since this place seems to be known for steaks I decided to go with it. And since I was ordering a steak I wanted one of the better cuts. If you are looking for $200 beef jerky and to be treated like crap upon check in you should make a \"reservation\" for this place.

The steak sandwich is a deal at $16, and my friend got a chicken and brie sandwich for $14, I believe - both were delicious. We sat on the patio and you have a great view of the Bellagio fountains (minus the palm trees on the Strip in between) and it's a great way to people-watch as well. They also gave us warm, freshly baked bread (at least it tasted like that) and it was delicious. I will definitely be back to Mon Ami next time I'm in Vegas.\",\n",

I asked to order Frisee, Kale & Warm Bacon Salad, Wild Escargots de Bourgogne, two Onion Soups Au Gratin, Classique steak and Chilled Seafood Platter. However, the server recommened one more entree, Grilled Pork Tenderloin because their portions are not enough. I also remember I wasn't satisfied with the portion last time. The foods were great, but a little bit salty. Also, I brought my family including 83 year old grandma here and she said she couldn't see what she was eating because it was too dark inside for her. I should've asked to sit outside instead for her. \\n\\nSince I haven't explorer French dishes much yet, I will come back and try other foods if I'm coming back to Vegas in near future.\",\n",

I'd pick this place over a buffet as I'm not a fan of stuffing myself until I can't breathe.\\n\\nSo I made reservations for 6:30pm for four. All of us ordered the most popular item of steak and frites on our last visit, but decided to change it up as soon as our waiter told us about the special. On a Saturday evening, they had the Grilled Bison Ribeye ($40). It only comes in medium rare as it would be too tough if it was cooked anymore. Before our entrees came, we ordered a large carafe of the Frangria ($30), which filled up about five full glasses. It was tasty and you could forget you're even drinking alcohol. On the other hand, the fruits soaked in the sangria was quite bitter and strong. Complimentary bread and butter was also served, which was warm and soft. We even had another helping of bread until our main course arrived. The presentation itself was already quite the perfect on the ribeye. Everything was incredibly flavorful as I hardly had to add anymore seasoning to my dish. Even the string beans, sprouts and sauteed onions had such a kick of saltiness marinated inside. I have to say that their sauteed onions were to completely die for! It was such an incredible combination of the steak and onions with every bite. This is the type of splurge everyone needs every once in awhile --for a juicy, tender slab of meat!\\n\\nSince we were celebrating my best friend and my birthday, we were even brought out a special birthday dessert. It was an ice cream cream puff drizzled with chocolate sauce. This was such a sweet touch to have them bring one out for each of us and sang us happy birthday --how lovely!\",\n",
       " \"First off, I was very close to giving Mon Ami Gabi 5 stars but one of the dishes I had was not too good.. (more later). However, the service was great. We were seated immediately (around 9pm) and got a heated table outside facing the Bellagio fountain. What a treat! We got to see the various shows over dinner.\\nI was delighted to discover they had a whole separate gluten-free menu for me. Imagine my delight to discover a gluten-free onion soup - yum! Now the House Made Country Pate was a disappointment though. The bread was good but the pate itself was kind of dry and taste was kind of bland and texture lumpy. We had had a snack earlier in the night so I wasn't able to eat anything else except dessert... the chocolate mousse was very very good. I know my friend was very very pleased with her meal too.\\nI would definitely come back again as I really wanted to try the lamb shank and would love to enjoy the Bellagio fountain again.\",\n",

       " 'We originally didn\\'t plan to come to Mon Ami Gabi for dinner but we were caught in the traffic on the Strip and were really hungry so we decided to get off of the bus and pick a random restaurant (not that random since I\\'ve bookmarked this on Yelp already!)\\n\\nThe restaurant was pretty packed and we had the choice between sitting at the patio (outdoor) or sitting on bar stools (indoor). I decided to go with the patio because it was really dark inside and the patio had some heater (so I thought it should be able to keep me warm)\\n\\nEven with the heaters above our heads, winter in Las Vegas was pretty pretty cold! My boyfriend exchanged seat with me because I was cold and he ended up wearing his down jacket for the entire night. \\n\\nBefore getting our appetizer and main courses, we were served with a complementary carrot salad (?) and a baguette. There was nothing special about the carrot salad..  In fact, I didn\\'t like it much. Their baguette was pretty good and I like how it was warm when it came.\\n\\nFor appetizer, we ordered their Sea Scallops Gratinées (caramelized fennel and onion marmalade, mussel cream). I was debating between scallops and snails (their escargots de Bourgogne) and ended up picking this because I love scallops! On a side note, their escargots looked delicious! I saw some people eating it when I was on my way out and kind of regret not ordering this instead! The scallops were really fresh and tender (not over-cooked). It was so tender and soft that I thought it was under-cooked! But I think I prefer it to be more cooked and maybe pan-seared too. The cheese on top of the scallops added more texture to this dish.\\n\\nI opted for their Poisson Du Jour, which was Alaskan cod. And I really liked my dish! The fish\\'s texture kind of reminded me of crab meat. My cod was very chewy and fresh! The mushrooms were good too (very well-seasoned)! Although I don\\'t like beans (and there were a lot of beans in this dish) but eating everything together was yummy! \\n\\nMy boyfriend opted for their Steak Roquefort (blue cheese sauce) The portion was quite big but the steak wasn\\'t \"wow wow\"... It wasn\\'t bad but I\\'ve definitely had better steak elsewhere. Somehow I feel that for that price, I should get a better quality steak.. My boyfriend was disappointed since he thinks The Keg\\'s blue cheese steak is better! Our waitress did recommend us another steak (Filet Mignon Merlot -butter, red wine reduction $32.95) but we didn\\'t want to spend that much, especially when the Canadian dollar is ridiculously low........!\\n\\nI was debating between giving Mon Ami Gabi 3 or 4 stars but decided to give them 4 because of the view (Bellagio fountains), the atmosphere and the whole dining experience. Our waitress was really sweet and attentive and the view was perfect for a romantic and pre-birthday dinner! \\n\\nWe did had an incident that scared me so much. There was a random individual on the street who decided to walk straight towards our table. I left my phone next to me while I was eating. I don\\'t know if it was because he saw it and wanted to steal it.. But my first instinct when he approached too close to us was to grab my phone. He then stared at me while I was staring at him and he took our salt and pepper away.. So, just be extra careful, pay attention to your surroundings, do not leave any valuable items on the table or unattended and keep your stuff close to you, especially in Vegas (lots of weird and drunk people)!',\n",

However, we were placed in the far corner hidden by an umbrella and pelted with horrible wind and smells from the alley way. It was shady and the heating lamp did not reach us. We were hardly approached by our waitress. I'm not a huge food critic so this review is to mainly address the poor service we received for the price we paid\",\n",

We were seated quickly in the rook next to the patio, which had plenty of natural light.  \\n\\nIt was by no means a memorable meal, but it was certainly not the worst meal we've ever had.

Our chicken entrees we're pretty bland.  My portion was cooked nicely, still moist but no seasonings at all.  Come on- put some herb de Provence or at least as&up on the bird.

We made dinner reservation for Saturday and still waited a good 30 mins for patio seating. It was totally worth it as it was quite romantic. As for food, it was pretty good and the price is reasonable. We got scallop gratin - which reminded us of scallops topped with French onion soup. We also got chicken pate which was also delicious.

       " \"This was a really great restaurant to start my Saturday. After a night of celebrating my birthday, I wanted something light,but satisfying to eat. I really had a taste for a croissant, but didn't see it on the menu, so I opted for the warm baguette with butter and jam on the side. While there are a plethora of menu options I could have chosen from, again, I wanted to keep things simple. There's something to be said and appreciated about an eatery that knows baguettes. The loaf was delivered warm, just asking to be buttered. Not only that, it had the perfect crusty exterior and soft, chewy interior.  When I buttered the loaf, you can see it quickly melt into all of the nooks a crannies with perfection. \\n\\nIn addition to the baguette, I also ordered a single shot of espresso, which was served hot. The flavor was slightly bitter, as it should be, with a rich, intense flavor. Although I will always favor the double shot espressos of France, this was an excellent runner-up. \\n\\nI neglected to mention I was able to sit in the self-seated section of the Bloody Mary Bar which looks out onto Las Vegas Boulevard. This was such a treat because there was an hour-long wait for patio seating...this was the next best thing. To finish my light breakfast on a high note, I had to try the Bloody Mary, and not just any BM, the build-your-own sort. My bartender, Robert H. (a very pleasant and accommodating fellow), offered several tomato juices, vodkas, hot sauces and accompanying speared items such as pickles, olives, lemons, bacon slice, cheese wedge and celery stalk, of course. It tasted as great as it looked!\\n\\nThis is such a wonderful eatery with beautiful views, including Caesars Palace, Bellagio's fountain shows and if you like, it's a great place to simply people watch and take in The Boulevard. I had a wonderful time and I certainly will be returning.\",\n",
       " \"Booked a reservation here for 7:30 on a Thursday night and was surprised we still had to wait in line... nonetheless - it moved fairly quickly and we were seated with a cozy table on the inside corner of the main dining room.  \\n\\nMy date and I ordered the warm brie for an appetizer and though he bit into a large (sexy) piece of garlic on first bite, we both agreed that the flavor was incredible.  I greedily slurped down the soup du jour - a carrot/ginger combination that went down like baby food - and ordered the filet mignon au poivre for my main course.  To die for.  The meat was cooked to order and I was only saddened that I couldn't finish because I was so full!  He had the NY strip prepared with carmelized onion and red wine sauce - and it too was amazing.  Both meats were served with the best hand-cut frites I've ever tasted... both crunchy and soft, flavored and oh so yummy... I'd go back just for those.  \\n\\nWe shared a bottle of Cotes Du Rhone and skipped dessert because we'd made reservations upstairs for Pistachio Souffle at the Eiffel. \\n\\nExcellent meal.  Romantic night setting.  Could have been the company, but I'd definitely return.\",\n",
       " \"Until last night I had only been to Mon Ami Gabi for business lunches.  We'd sit on the patio overlooking the strip and I'd order good food, but be green with envy of all the people who were there just for the pleasure of it.  I adore my clients and enjoy their company very much, but lets face it, its not the same as a cozy, romatic dinner for two.\\n\\nI didn't get the romance last night, but did have dinner on the patio with another client, who I also consider a friend.  We got there around 6:30 and were seated on the patio after just a few minutes wait.  We apparently arrived just in time because it was packed.  Like other yelpers have mentioned, there's great people watching because you are literally sitting right above the strip.......and having the water fountains at Bellagio across the street adds to the ambience and uniqueness of being in Las Vegas.  Unfortunately we only got to see one show because the wind interferred.   But the wind (I'd call it more of a breeze) felt great and the weather was perfect.  We ordered a bottle of Sancerre, which always makes me happy, and it was the perfect wine to enjoy underneath the setting sun (hmmmmm, this does sound kind of romantic, doesn't it?).  For an appetizer, we ordered the steamed artichoke, which was very good with a lemon mayo for dipping and for dinner I had the scallops atop a cauliflower mash and spinach.  My friend had the skate, which was perfect too.  We also ordered a side of roasted beets, which is where the one slip up happened with us.  Our server forgot to bring it until we were pretty much through with dinner, so they didn't charge us for it.....and it was yummy. \\n\\nFinding a fabulous meal in Las Vegas is very easy.  Finding one that doesn't cost over $100 per person is not.  Our total dinner came out to around $150 including the wine and the tip.  What adds to this being such a great value is that it is one of the only places (that I know of) where you can sit outside right on Las Vegas Boulevard.  If you are in Las Vegas for vacation, then this will certainly enhance that feeling of being in the center of things.  There's Trader Vic's next door, but its a totally different vibe....more of a lounge/bar than a restaurant patio.\",\n",

This place is always the best alternative when I can't think of anywhere else to go and i always leave satisfied. Dinner is better than lunch here at Mon Ami.

Throughout our meal we were treated to exceptional service.  \\n\\nWe immediately ordered a pate which, we had 2 to choose from.

I swear I could feel my thighs expand with each spoon of cheesy soup!!! For lunch entree I had the Warm chicken & Bree sandwich which was OK!! nothing out of the ordinary. My husband ordered the cream of mushroom (i think thats the name) which was delicious. And for lunch he had the Quiche Lorraine which was really really really buttery. My husband is not a difficult man to please when it comes to food. He never leaves a plate with food on it.  Today was the first time seeing him barely touch his plate! I am not sure if it was the eggs or the butter or the crust being even triple buttered as well, it just was not good! You can say that I am a harsh critic, but my God my husband didn't finish it!!! I could not even swallow the bite I tried!!!! I had high hopes after reading all the yelp reviews! I wish it was better, maybe the steak would have been a safer order which was his original thought but poor thing he figured he would try something different!!!

       " 'My experience was soured by our first interaction with the management staff. The hostess was seating us at a table near the kitchen, which I specifically said I did not want in my reservation request, so I pointed to a table for two near the windows to the patio (which is what I had requested.) She said \"sure\" but began walking us in a different direction. The manager, who had been standing nearby and overheard my request, began repeatedly yelling a table number at the hostess, and when she didn\\'t immediately respond, he clapped his hands in her face and rudely pointed her to the table I had requested. It was embarrassing for me as a guest to have the manager basically treat the hostess as if she were an animal (perhaps he clapped in her face because he didn\\'t know her name, which is just as pathetic.) I told her \"I\\'m sorry. That was not okay.\" She was almost in tears, as I\\'m sure she was humiliated as well.  I can only assume that this is his normal behavior, as I also saw him shoo a busser away from a table in a very degrading manner as well.  In the event that any upper management would like to educate this particular person on the proper treatment of his staff, I would identify him as a thin, taller man in his mid fifties, working on Wednesday, September 4th around 10:30 am. \\nMy star rating is not based on this experience, rather, it is based on the food. Our server, Ryan, was extremely prompt, knowledgeable, and friendly. Our meals were good, but nothing amazing. My husband had the French toast and I had the eggs Benedict. Neither entree was hot...just warm. My breakfast potatoes (aka hash browns) were barely warm. I assume they would have remade the dishes had we said something, but I really didn\\'t want to wait. The coffee was very weak...like coffee flavored water.\\nThe highlight of the meal was definitely the bacon. (Thank you to Ryan for encouraging me to order it!)

I ordered a medium burger ready for a juicy hamburger.  I received a dry burger that lacked flavor.   The frites were still great as usual.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.',\n",
       " \"This is one of my favorite restaurants. The view on the patio is perfect--the Bellagio fountains; but even inside is nice, like a French café. The onion soup is the best. The broth is out fabulous, and they put in the right amount of bread and cheese. The French bread is just as good, always fresh out of the oven , and their butter tastes better too for some reason. My favorite is the Steak Frites with blue cheese butter. The meat isn't a premium cut, but they serve it thin and cooked full of flavor. Their French fries are great too. The truth is, this is a great meal.\",\n",

       " \"Just had a birthday lunch for my wife's 50th birthday. \\n\\nWe had reservations which made seating quick and easy., even though the place was really packed. \\n\\nThe waitress Christina was fantastic,  unfortunately,  her busboy was awful. We had to ask 3 times to get bread and soda refills.  We could see the busboy who often appeared to be looking off into space even though we tried to get his attention by waving and calling to him.  Christina was very apologetic and ended up getting the bread and soda herself. \\n\\nEveryone at the table enjoyed their food except for me.   I ordered the filet cooked medium and doubled checked how it was prepared to ensure I wouldn't have to send it back. Wouldn't you know it, it was over cooked.   Christina took it back,  but it was replaced with one that was rare.   Given that most of my party had nearly finished and I was starving  I chose to eat part of it and left the really rare part on the plate. Again Christina was profusely apologetic and it was removed from our bill. \\n\\nOverall, the staff took care of everything especially Christina and the manager.  The only thing I was surprised about is that while the gratuity was added in because of our party size, the gratuity was included for 2 filets even though they took them off the bill.\\n\\nThe end result.  Pretty good food and a great waitress, just don't order filet when it is busy if you are expecting it to be cooked as ordered.\",\n",
       " 'My first time in Las Vegas. I wanted to find a romantic place that was different, classy and fun. I found it in Mon Ami Gabi. My girlfriend and I took the slow gastro route and slowly ate and imbibed for over 2 1/2 hours. We never felt rushed and our waitress was awesome. Attentive but not intrusive. She would periodically come and check on us, top off our wine and disappear. Wonderful service. \\n\\nUpon seating we were topped off with water and brought a hot loaf of bread with butter and a dip that looked like carrot that was tasty and welcomed as we checked out the menu. \\n\\nWe had escargot, and tuna tartar as appetizers. And shared the Hanger steak as an entree which was cooked to medium rare perfection. I would highly recommend this place to anyone but I would advise reservations and outdoor patio seating as the inside did not look so appealing due to the space, noise, although it was nice and dark which I like. Another added benefit to seating outside is you get to people watch (which is very entertaining on the Las Vegas strip) and you get to watch the bellagio water show.',\n",
       " \"I think this is one of my new favorite restaurants ever. The setting is very romantic, the location is convenient, the food is delicious, and it is not prohibitively expensive. The service was a little inconsistent, as our waiter was a little abrupt and unprofessional, but the other employees were very friendly and quick to keep our water glasses full and clear plates. \\n\\nWe made a reservation through Yelp for 8 p.m. with only an hour's notice on a Friday night with no problems. That turned out to be a great decision, as there was a long line for walk-ins around then, and we were seated right away. \\n\\nThe baguette and butter served before our meal was delicious, but we were smart to limit the bread - the steak frites we both ordered were delicious and way too big to finish. We also shared a shrimp cocktail, which was the best I've ever tasted. \\n\\nWe skipped dessert, but I'm sure everything on the dessert menu is delicious.\",\n",

We were also provided with complementary French bread aka baguette. The baguette was very fresh and soft where it matters. One of the better rolls I\\'ve had in Las Vegas. The crab salad was tasty though it wasn\\'t exceptionally different than anything I\\'ve had in the past for a similar quality restaurant. I also ordered a freshly squeezed orange juice ($3.99). It was pretty good though a bit small. Order two if needed! Fresh juice is also available for grapefruit.\\n\\nService: 4.5 stars for the service. We were seated quickly and received our food within a reasonable amount of time. They were courteous and friendly. \\n\\nAmbiance: 5 stars for the ambiance. You can\\'t really beat having a great view of the Bellagio fountains. Although we did not seat directly in front of it, I could still see it on the side if I lean my body over. TIP: Try getting a \"front\" row seat aka outdoors across the street from the fountain or directly behind the outdoor seating area for a spectacular view of the free show across the street. Love it. \\n\\nLocation: Great mid/central strip location. Near several great places - two of my favorite shopping malls in Vegas aka Miracle Mile at Planet Hollywood and the Forum Shops at Cesar Palace. Paris has some affordable restaurants at a great location. \\n\\nTransportation: Save yourself some money and get an all day bus pass ($7). The bus stop is right in front of the hotel/restaurant and is available 24 hours a day! \\n\\nPayment: Takes credit card and cash. Easy going about parties splitting their bill as well.\\n\\nWill return again for brunch. Want to try breakfast next time.',\n",

The merlot wine mixed well and made the steak very flavorful. This is one of their signature dish.

It came with a little bit of yogurt too and the price was great, only 8 bucks.\\n\\n- Complaint about the manager - right when we arrived at the restaurant, she came up with this extremely rude tone and asked if my dog was a service animal (he has a clearly visible vest on saying so). We said yes he was and she laughed and said \"OK, what service does he provide for you then?\" ... It is actually illegal for her to ask that question but she was going to force us to leave and I didn\\'t feel like dealing with security or any drama at the end of my trip so I have her the info. Without saying thank you she just laughed again and said \"fine but keep him off the seats and he cannot eat food.\" We obviously know this as we have trained him and complied with all rules at every other restaurant. First time ever I was treated this way and I wish I knew what her name was so I could report it to upper management, but the rest of the staff were extremely helpful and nice and I will not review my entire experience as bad because of one bad apple.\\n\\nWe will be back, and hope that manager is not there :)',\n",

If I was in Vegas right now I would go to dinner and eat the scallops.\\n\\nWhat made the scallops even better...the service was impeccable and the view was 5 stars!

We sat on the patio and had a view of the strip sitting underneath the Eiffel Tower and across the street from the Bellagio fountain show. Every 10-15 minutes a new song and fountain show was entertaining us. \\n\\nOh, and not to be forgotten is the fresh french baguettes that are served with delish butter.

There was no wait although the restaurant was quite busy. \\nThere were misters in the patio to keep us cool as well as umbrellas, I ordered a mimosa and my fiancé ordered a Bloody Mary. The mimosa was delicious, and the Bloody Mary my fiancé came back with from the DIY bloody bar encouraged me to order one as well. \\nWe began our meals with chicken liver pâté and a smoked salmon plate. The pâté was very rich but delicious and the smoked salmon was divine. I ended up eating just the salmon and capers as the toasts it was served with began to fill me up a bit. \\nAfter our appetizers we got a Croque Madame with frites. The Gruyere on the Madame was so delicious and the sunny side up egg soaked into the bread perfectly. all I could hear were angels singing.

I must admit though, I was quite tipsy walking into the restaurant, despite taking 5 or so shots of Gentlemen's Jack, w/2 beers--yeah, pretty drunk by that time :/  \\n\\nThe servers at the entrance were super friendly, and had the table waiting for us already. \\n\\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is very classic-like; interestingly enough, it doesn't have much of a french look, but rather a good ol' American steak house.  We asked the waitress what would be best recommend, and I simply went with their good recs.  Man, they were so right on the money.  The steak was amazingly delicious, and the crispy fries were just well cooked.  I felt the food portions were just perfect for the price.

Best way to dine at this place is by eating at their patio and preferably near the railing, no other exceptions.  Make sure to have a reservation especially if you decide to eat at this restaurant on a weekend or expect for your party to wait until the next table is ready.  Wait time, however, is usually nonexistent if you do show up early enough.  At least they have two bars conveniently inside the establishment that serve any alcoholic beverage you desire as you wait for your name to be called.\\n\\nWatch out for their daily specials as they're actually quite delicious.  One dish I tend to go for is their crepe stuffed with chicken, brie and apples topped with a beurre blanc sauce...amazing!!  Another great choice would be the eggs florentine with a side of date-glazed bacon.\\n\\nOverall, Mon Ami Gabi has definitely become an institution that everyone seems to keep raving about.

Their service is top notch and the food is really incredible. Everything we've ordered has been delicious, from breakfast and brunch items to dinner. It's definitely a good idea to make a reservation so you don't have to wait, although their patio seating is first come, first serve. During our most recent visit, my husband and I shared the frisée, kale, and warm bacon salad with a soft-poached egg, he ordered the cinnamon pancake, which was a large crepe with a side of blueberries (brunch was over but they accommodated him anyhow), and I had the seafood crepe. Their crepe batters are perfect, never chewy, and so delicately thin. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant!\",\n",

Although I wasn't a huge fan of what I ordered, the other 3 people I was with all really liked their food and I liked the tastes I got of their meals.  We had: a lobster roll with homemade chips, steak frites classique, steak sandwich, and a chicken, brie and apple sandwich.  The lobster roll and steak dishes all got rave reviews.  My chicken/brie sandwhich was ok but the apples had a sour taste and I thought the filling:bread ratio was very low.  I loved the frites that came with it though and the bites of steak I had were great.   Service was good (although they were out of the first entree my mom wanted, the trout almondine, but she loved the lobster roll so it was ok) and the ambiance is pretty nice too.  We ate inside so we didn't have much fountain view but it was still a nice setting.  They serve a warm, crusty French bread before the meal that is just great.

The lighting inside is great for a romantic evening dinner, but a bit too drab if you're trying to catch up with friends.

I would recommend any of the following best enjoyed with cup of coffee while facing the Bellagio fountains and observing the parade of characters lining Las Vegas Blvd.  \\n\\n1.  Blueberry waffles:  with a crisp exterior and pillowy soft interior, the belgian waffle is topped with fresh blueberries along with warm blueberry sauce and freshly whipped cream.\\n\\n2.

For a cocktail, I ordered their French Martini, which arrived room temperature and left a weird aftertaste in my mouth. It would have been much better chilled. For the main entrée, I had the Steak Roquefort (rare) and Frites. Firstly, the plate did not look very appetizing. It was a large, thin piece of meat with a glob of bleu cheese sauce in the middle and thinly cut fries haphazardly thrown on the side. Secondly, the meat was tough.

The ambiance is nice and we were seated almost immediately close to the patio so we had a good view of the strip, however, the waiter seemed like he was not in a good mood and it also felt like he was trying to rush us out of there. \\nWe started off with the oyster and corn chowder soup and wild escargots, the chowder was good but the escargots were very bland. I ordered the pulled pork brisket bánh mì, the pork didn't have much flavor and it was served in soft bread, not the typical baguette that I'm used to. My boyfriend ordered the Maine lobster roll and it was decent. Overall, the food and service was definitely not worth the price to me, perhaps if all you want is the view.\",\n",

Beautiful view of the dazzling Bellagio fountains (if you dine al fresco on their outdoor patio) Incredible ambiance, amazing food, service and wait staff!! The prices are extremely reasonable for a strip restaurant with a prime view!! I highly recommend their scallops, steak frites, and any salmon dish!! Great wine list and desserts!! Good coffee also!! Worth the wait time if you don't have a reservation. Been here numerous times for dinner, but now have to make it a point to come in for breakfast or brunch one of these days. I heard it is fantastic!!\",\n",
       " \"I had the Bone-In Ribeye, and it was ok. I ordered it rare, and it came with a very nice red interior. It was also pretty tender, but it could've used more seasoning to bring out the beefy flavor. The black peppercorns were very coarsely grounded so some bites were overly peppery. On the plus side, the ribeye had a good sized rim/cap/deckle/whatever you call that piece of meat surrounding the edge of a ribeye. That's literally the best piece of meat from a cow.\",\n",

I got what they said is they specialty - the filet and frites. We had the escargot to start which was good, and the baguettes were excellent as expected. The filet was perfectly cooked and delicious, and the frites were also great.\\n\\nMy girlfriend wasn't in the mood for steak and ordered scallops, and she was surprised how good they were.

The ice cream sundae we ordered came without a spoon and they said they were looking for one, which took about fifteen minutes. By the time the spoon came, the sundae was slightly melted. The seafood tower is a great deal. I think it\\'s one of their better options. They have a mignonette, cocktail sauce, lobster tail, oysters, shrimp, crab legs, and everything tasted fresh on two different occasions. Their bloody mary bar is pretty cool. The meat sticks are where it\\'s at. Their steak frites is a solid option. I have enjoyed their steak frites on three different occasions. The salads are also all not bad, and their onion soup is very oniony and enjoyable. The layer of cheese is so delicious. Their crepes are okay.\\n\\nThe hostesses could some times have an attitude. Their level of niceness is hit or miss also. I feel like some of them really don\\'t like kids or something. One hostess rolled her eye at my son. The servers are all generally really nice. However, they can become very busy. \\n\\nI will definitely be back as my husband often gets \"Lettuce Entertain You\" gift cards.

With all my heart and soul...I loved the view, the ambiance, the waiters, the food and the je ne se quoi (sp), and I had had a long-standing relationship with this restaurant, visiting at least 2-3 times a year for the past 4-5 years.  It was love at first bite and I never made a trip to Vegas without visiting at least once.  Now, I\\'m afraid to say, I\\'m not likely to go back.  \\n\\nOn a recent visit near the end of December, I was excited to bring 3 friends to Mon Ami.  Now, while the restaurant is known as a steakhouse, they offer many fish dishes on their menu.  On the night we came in, with an 8 pm reservation, we were informed that they were out of ALL of them.  The waitress quickly let us know, very unapologetically, that they were out of lobster, mussels, skate, trout, salmon, scallops and any other fish on the menu that evening.  We were hell-bent on getting the mussels, one of our favorite appetizer dishes at Mon Ami, and one of our visitors had his heart set on lobster.  When we asked why there was no fish available, when clearly it was largely offered on the menu, the waitress simply answered \"our fish truck didn\\'t come today.\"  Now, mistakes happen.  The world is an imperfect place.  Fish trucks miss their deliveries.  I am not a restaurateur (though I know one in the Henderson area), but I would imagine that a restaurant of this size with the volume of business that Mon Ami does  would have a back up plan should a truck not arrive.  If not, might I suggest that there is a Whole Foods store less than 3 miles away where perhaps they might have gone to pick up some fish?  \\n\\nAfter expressing our disappointment, the waitress shared that she heard a rumor that some mussels had come in, and she would bring them to us right away.  She did, we ate them, they tasted gummy and fishy and we complained about them for the rest of our trip.  After eating steaks con frites (umm, what else were we supposed to eat at that point), we left, disappointed with the restaurant\\'s lack of selection and poor planning, but mostly, with how their staff chose to handle the situation...without any true apologies or sense of ownership.

Scary fast.  The servers are usually from another city other than Vegas, and are friendly and willing to chit chat a bit if you are so inclined.  The buidling itself is great.  Clean, high ceilings in one part, dark wood and dimlyl lit in other parts, and they also have a huge patio with a view of the strip.  The food is just amazing.  Is it a bit pricey?  Sure, but much cheaper than the Eiffel Tower restaurant and well worth it in my opinion.

Dip the bread they provide in the mussel sauce goes well together. \\n\\nNow for the reason for 3 stars.

The bacon was literally burned to a crisp and tasted burned. We asked for new bacon and informed the waitress that we didn't want our bacon burned. A few minutes later we were brought bacon that looked identical to what we just sent back...burnt to a crisp. Rather than send back yet another side of bacon and waste more food we just accepted it.

We decided to go with seafood because we had enough of buffets and steaks. We ordered 3 dishes: Mussels Mariniere (white wine and herbs), Escargots, Seared Sea Scallops. I must admit I was really impressed with the Scallops and Mussels. Scallops and Mussles were really fresh and tender. Due to bad experiences with escargots, i have not had it for years until I came to Mon Ami Gabi. And lets just say the escargot was not too bad. Also, i believe the mussels came with fries, which tasted like chips. Not bad. \\n\\nDinner was served quickly. Service was great. We didn't need to rush for the show. We had more than enough time.

It was great, but I couldn't finish it all! I ordered a Steak Dijon and it was good, but they could have been a bitttt more generous with the sauce. My brother's Steak Merlot was ok given that he ordered it medium well. (not a big fan of anything more than medium) My dad's filet mignon...MMMMMMMMMMM...YUMMY! He doesn't like bloody stuff, so it was well done and still!!! I'd think it'd be difficult to order a tasty well done filet mignon, but this chef did it! Meat was not burnt, hard, or super chewy. Nice and tender. Delicious!!! I've got nothing but compliments for their food. My mom had the Trout Amandine. I expected it to be so-so, but goodness! It was practically boneless and the fish was sooooooo soft. It felt like it just melted in my mouth. I ordered a banana crepe afterward and it was okay!

From the waiter's recommendation I chose the sandwich over their Steak and Frites. IT WAS DELICIOUS. The bread was ok but the chicken was juicy, the caramelized onions gave a sweet touch, and sliced green apples really packed the crunch! I even asked for a side of pickles just to get all my flavors going. MUST ORDER!\\n\\n[[ Prime Rib Steak sandwich ]]-- BF loves his prime rib and this sandwich was perfect! Came on sliced baguette and though I thought the bread was too tough, the meat was super juicy and tender and you really get your money's worth of prime rib stuffed into your sandwich. EXCELLENT!\\n\\n+ It seems everyone was enjoying the DIY Bloody Mary bar and next time we'll have to give it a shot.

Everyone decided to have the steak so I obviously had a salad and scallops hoping to finish everyone's steak (which of course I did)!!! I had the soft boiled and bacon salad- oh so yum. Imagine a nice fresh salad covered in bacon and a warm soft boiled egg over. As you cut the egg the magical yolk pours over the salad. The salad also has little pieces of toast that soak up the egg yolk. I'm salivating as I write this. Then I had the scallops gratin which was amazing. Fresh scallops smothered in buttah and cheese baked to perfection. Get a piece of warm baguette to dip and you are in business. Then I tried everyone's steak and every style was amazing. I prefer the classic butter- medium rare but everyone style was wonderful. I love the fries too- they are fried but not greasy. Dip those bad boys in bearnaise sauce and you've got fireworks. We also had the chocolate mousse which was rich and decadent. For drinks we split the sangria which was flavorful and strong! Yum! Loved this meal.\",\n",

       " '\"the most DIGUSTING service from your server Sasha and the bussers\"\\n\\n\\n**wrote to the President of the restaurant and never received a follow up either**\\n\\nLong overdue review from April 2017, but I am still disgusted by the service we received from that obnoxious waitress Sasha (long reddish blonde hair in a high bun, thin, late 20s, black square rim glasses) and the bussers, whom had the decency to hang around next to our table when Sasha picked up the rejected dish and announced that I did not know the difference between porterhouse and steaks. Dirty looks from the bussers followed. Our whole table heard that I specifically asked if the porterhouse serving for the evening would be beef or not, as the menu was mostly dedicated to beef steak. When I asked Sasha that she informed me that the porterhouse would be beef (which was also the reason why I ordered it in medium rare), she adamantly said that she would never say that. She also said that I should not have spoken to the other bussers, as they did not know any better (talking about putting down your co-workers). She then threw me the menu and said that she would come back to take my order again. That was when she took the porterhouse and announced to other bussers about her \"stupid\" guest. She came back later and asked what I would like. I pointed to the menu and asked what were the difference between the 2 steaks on the menu besides the sauces. She rolled her eyes and said that there was no difference, except for the sauces. I was extremely upset at her attitude and manner. I asked immediately to speak with a manager. She slowly went to a female manager Sarah, explained herself, and left. The female manager stated that the establishment was a high end steakhouse and that they pride themselves over excellent customer service. She said she was not present during my conversations with the waitress so she could not absolutely say who was at fault. She took my order for a steak, and did not check in with us for the remaining evening. Another server Chanel stepped in and was attentive to us for the evening. I applaud her as she knew how furious we were.\\n\\nNot only was Sasha\\'s behavior extremely rude and she also belittled other bussers, she also denied her behavior & argued with guests, never showed an apologetic attitude, not to mentioned being extremely arrogant in talking bad about guests in front of them. The other service members also behaved poorly in participating in such gossips. I can only sum up that what happened to us reflects how poorly managed and unprofessional this establishment is. For what we went through, I expected Sarah/other managers/ GM, would stop by to check in on us, or at least during billing to apologize again for our terrible experience. I saw that 50% was taken off on our bill without a note or anything, so we paid and I left a big gratuity for Chanel. Honestly, the 50% discount felt insulting. It would have been appreciated if a manager had stopped by and informed us in person and invited us to return next time for a better experience, instead of a 50% off the bill. That would be the difference between superb customer service and \"just give them a discount to shut them up and send them off their merry way.\" We were in Vegas and the establishment for a good time, instead, we were completely insulted and belittled by the service team. We would have gotten much more genuine, sincere, and more polished service from deli, than from this poorly managed and utterly rude establishment.',\n",

The flavor is sumptuous and cooked to perfection. I ordered their mussels which came with french fries. It was cooked well and the juice is adequately flavored and salted. It was a bit creamy. Our friends ordered the salmon and roast beef. They also loved their dishes and thanked us for taking them to Mon Ami Gabi. For dessert, we ordered the pudding and it was delicious. \\nThis restaurant will always be in our itinerary when we visit Vegas, that's for sure. \\nFYI: Be sure to make a reservation to avoid waiting a long time. If you want to sit outside so you can watch the Bellagio Fountain while eating dinner, you way have to sign in anew and wait. The wait depends on how busy they are. Last year we waited a long time to be weated outside, this year we did not so it just depends. But having a reservation is better not having one and be ready to walk around Paris for a few minutes if there is a longer wait time to get seated outside.

       " \"Boyfriend's sister and her boyfriend work in the same restaurant group as Mon Ami Gabi, and he raved about it the last time they went as a family. So he took me there when I got back in town and even made reservations for the patio. (Fyi: they don't take patio reservations.) We were waiting for a railing table, but apparently it was taking too long, so they seated us in the inner patio. I didn't quite like being here because we seemed to be on the borderline between the cold a/c from inside and the warm Las Vegas evening air of outside. It was an odd combination and slightly uncomfortable. But I can't deny that they do have a great location on the Strip.\\n\\nThe warm baguettes were tasty, although our second one was a bit burned... And apparently the butter was just amazing, according to Boyfriend. It tasted like butter to me. =P Their bottles of wine are a bit on the pricy end, with the cheapest at $39. We got a $40 bottle. And I'm sad to say that I wasn't too impressed with the food we ordered. I got the Filet Mignon with merlot butter and red wine reduction cos our waiter said that was the chef's specialty. Boyfriend said that the one with creme fraiche that he had gotten last time was better. And I compared it to the best filet mignon I've had to date, which was at Meritage in Boston. I ordered that one medium, while I ordered this one medium rare, and that one was still more tender than this one. Now I'm no expert on beef cuts, but all I know is 1) this one was definitely smaller than the other, 2) it was stringier and not as tender, and 3) it just wasn't as tasty as the other. I also had this odd problem of the plate maybe being too light for the amount of sawing I had to do for the steak, so the entire plate would skid around. Mph. Boyfriend ordered the Steak Roquefort (blue cheese sauce) with a sort of mashed potatoes instead of the fries. I think he said it could've used more blue cheese. We got the dessert du jour on the house, which was nice. Crepe with strawberries and mango and a ball of vanilla ice-cream.\\n\\nThe service we got was good. Our waiter did seem offstandish at times, but he never crossed the line to being downright snobby. Boyfriend said he was sooo French (he's lived in France for a year), but he turned out to be Turkish! =] I have this affinity for Turkish people for some reason. He was very agreeable once we stroke up this conversation with him. I did wish the waiters had name-tags instead of number-tags...

       " \"My husband and I were so glad that we picked Mon Ami Gabi in the many choices of Vegas restaurants. We both think that was one of the best dinner in Vegas so far for us. \\n\\nWe made a reservation originally. But when we got there, there was no line for patio seating. Because I have read so much about the patio seating, we decided to sit on the patio. It was incredible. Although there were trees between Paris hotel and Bellagio, you can still see the water show pretty well. Every 15 mins, you can listen to the music and enjoy the show without standing. \\n\\nThe best part was the food. The bread was great, and it tasted very good with the carrot topping. We had the FRENCH ONION SOUP first. Unlike other french onion soup, this broth was very light. There was so much cheese, and the cheese was good. \\n\\nFor main course, I had SEARED SALMON. The salmon was perfectly cooked and moist. The lemon creme fraiche was excellent! There can't be a better match. I wish I know how to make this dish! \\n\\nMy husband ordered FILET MIGNON WITH BLUE CHEESE SAUCE. He put those two things together. It wasn't on the menu. When I had the first bite of the beef, the strong favor of the blue cheese hit me right away. Then, I can taste the beef. The beef was so tender. It can almost melt in my mouth. The frites were delicious too. The more you eat them, the more you like them! \\n\\nWe couldn't pass on the dessert. We had CREME BRULEE. That was the BEST creme brulee that I had in my life. Creamy and sweet! \\n\\nThe meal was wonderful! The service was great! And, the view was amazing! The price wasn't too scary either. It was about $80 for the two of us. \\n\\nI know that I will be coming back to this restaurant, when I am back in Vegas next time.\",\n",
       " 'I don\\'t mean to be harsh, but I\\'ll never eat there again. \\n\\nSirloin should not be prepared that way, it was flat and tough. I\\'ve never had a sirloin that was as tough as that. I got the steak classic, sauce was good, but couldn\\'t deliver the steak. I hear the view is nice on the patio but we ate inside to escape the heat so I had to leave my rating at two stars. FYI, total came out to $31 for 9 ounces of \"Sirloin\".',\n",

It was awesome!\\n\\nFirst off, Patio dining again, definitely a must when you go here as I've said before.  The atmosphere is a lot more different than it is at dinner time (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=gFFS-8Yc5e4B0s6VZiQtWg).  It's a little less hectic and more relaxing.  I could've just sat here and drank coffee all morning while people-watching.  It was that mellow.\\n\\nStarted off with some fresh OJ and bottomless Coffee.  I was really craving a good Eggs Benedict so I ordered their Crab Cake Eggs Benedict (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=XMlXu9ZuqJ795S6cPb68fw).  That was really good, but then again, I'm a fan of any Eggs Benedict done anywhere.  But believe it or not, I thought it was the Hash Browns that stole the show.  They were cooked with caramelized onions so they had a nice sweet flavor, almost like latkes.  Good stuff!!\\n\\nBecause I was there super early, I must've had like 20 waiters serving me.  Extreme service!!  It was like every time I would take a sip of my coffee, a waiter would come out of nowhere and refill it.  That was awesome!  I gave a big tip, but I wasn't sure who it was going to.\\n\\nI love this place.  5 stars once again!!!\",\n",
       " 'Came here again from California.  I was seated right away, and the food came very quickly.  Oysters were okay this time around, but the steak classique really rocks my world.  Also the warm goat cheese and garlic bread were to die for.  Will be coming back soon!',\n",

Even sharing it, i still couldn't finish my half, so I pulled out the meat and ate that instead of all the bread. \\nThe steak frites that came with it was my fave part of this dish. The most intriguing part was that it was like a cross between a fry and a potatoe chip. \\nThe rest of the girls got their own individual plates, and said that was too much food for one person, so I might recommend sharing a plate. \\nWe sat outside in the patio and there was a wonderful breeze, fun for people watching and you get a great view of the Bellagio water fountains from across the street.

We asked for an inside table for a late breakfast as it was hot and I wasn\\'t feeling being on the outside to people and fountain watch (which wasn\\'t happening anyway since it was daytime).  Luckily they sat us \"inside\" on the edge of the patio seating so we still got a decent view of both the outside and the inside, with air conditioning keeping us cool.  \\n\\nThe crepes are amazing here.  I enjoyed the chicken, brie and apple crepe while my husband enjoyed the egg, bacon and cheese one.  The kids decided to go with the steak and eggs and a croque monsieur.  We all pretty much licked our plates clean.  One thing I noticed is that they do potatoes here really well.  The hash browns and the pommes frites were excellent.  Afterwards, we shared a couple dessert crepes, a strawberry one and a banana fosters one.  I would definitely order the banana fosters again.  The caramel on it was delicious.  \\n\\nService was amazing and the people watching is on point.  I will definitely add this place to my rotation next time I visit, which I hope will be sooner rather than later.

So instead, we called in and placed our name on the reservation list of Mon Ami Gabi once we arrived on the Strip.  Because of the congestion and the time it takes to walk even across the street, give yourself a 30 min leeway to park your car, walk through the casino, etc..  \\n\\nFor lunch, they have an outdoor patio but also an \"indoor area\" that still gets the natural sunlight and a partial view of the Bellagio Fountain show which is what attracted us to this option.  Although not cheap with entrees running about $15-$20 for lunch, it isn\\'t the most expensive option either since Vegas boasts many high end restaurants these days.  \\n\\nThe seafood crepes had both scallops and shrimp and although the scallops in this and the entrée was a little on the saltier side, the fresh crunchy baguette they give you will offset any imperfections.',\n",

This added a fun air of hustle-and-bustle that you might experience in a Parisian Bistro. It was fine at lunch time, but might not be what you want during a romantic date night dinner.\\n\\nI Started with the Onion Soup au Gratin, which arrived piping hot and topped with a bubbling layer of gratineed cheese. The soup itself was far too sweet and far too gloopy, a symptom of the baguette slices that had been submerged in the dish rather than floated on top of it as is traditional.\\n\\nMy entree was much better; filet of Pacific Snapper pan-fried in a light herb batter that lent a subtle texture to the fish. The fish sat on top of lobster cream and butternut squash orzo pasta, which was light and flavorful. \\n\\nThere was a broad selection of French wines available, plus a limited, but high quality selection of beers.\\n\\nI would eat at Mon Ami Gabi again.',\n",

And for gf breakfast options they have gf french toast and regular gf toast that comes with the egg dishes! The bacon and hash browns were pretty good, pretty standard but overall it was a very satisfying breakfast. The ambiance is cute and very French. At first we were seated outside, but as soon as we sat down varies staff members warned us that our table would get very hot very quickly since there was hardly any shade on it. We moved inside.

The Brussels Sprouts were great as well, but I may have I counted but 11 halves, which sadly calculates to nearly a buck a sprout.\\n\\nThere was a purpose to having had a green dinner.  In addition to my felt need to consume some veggies in Vegas, I wanted dessert.

My wife had the lobster roll, which was her second choice (she had asked for the trout almondine, but was told after she ordered it that the trout had not made it to the restaurant yet that day). She was, however, very satisfied with her lobster roll, and was particularly pleased that it was served on a Maine-style bun. My SIL enjoyed his steak sandwich. My daughter wasn't wild about her chicken/brie/apple sandwich; she thought it had a sour taste. The bite she gave me did have a bit of a sour taste to it (probably from the apples), but I didn't mind it at all, although being a true carnivore I preferred my steak. \\n\\nThe meal was preceded by a fabulous crusty baguette, served with butter.

Until you see the hungover frat boys plop down at the table next to you and an overweight couple in visors and fanny-packs plop down at the table on the other side of you.\\n\\nThe staff is friendly and helpful for the most part, and when I asked for the recipe for the vinaigrette, they came back from the kitchen with a little form asking for my name, email address, and what recipe I wanted (I threw in a request for the quiche while I was at it) and the chef would email me soon.\\n\\nOverall, I can't wait to go back, maybe for something else (the blueberry waffles looked amazing), but probably for the quiche!\",\n",

The shrimp was seasoned well and tasted good, but a little overcooked. The scallops were my favorite part. It was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and had a nice crust on it. \\n\\nOverall: I thought the dish was good, but seemed to lack that oomph.

This dining experience would have been disappointing if I'd spent $10. The fact that my entree set me back $25 was just painful.\\n\\nThe only real reason to dine at Mon Ami Gabi is if you snag an outdoor table in order to people watch and take in the Bellagio fountain across the street.

One tip I have is that to get to the restaurant you have to actually go through the Paris Hotel. They have a very nice patio but being it was over 100 Degrees in Vegas, my sister and I decided to sit inside where there's AC even though I do love people watching especially in Vegas haha \\n\\nService was a bit slow given the 4 star review.

       " 'Every month, our team at work plans a team building event for us to get to know one another outside of the office. For the month of March, we wanted to do it big.  We wanted to experience something out of the norm, somewhere that required a dress up opportunity. There were a few options, however, we all ended up deciding on Mon Ami Gabi for our \"Fancy Dinner\" event. Boy were we excited!\\n\\nWhen you enter the restaurant, you immediately hit the bar area. Along with the hostess stand, you see a bunch of high top tables and bar seating. The place just exudes a romantic vibe! It\\'s located directly under the Vegas version Eiffel Tower and along the strip sidewalk. The lights in the location are dim and intimate, the white table clothes bring the upscale element. Wine glasses on the table sparkled brightly. Man, we were excited! Our table top was on the south end of the restaurant and the corner windows viewed the sidewalk veranda and the tower base. Our server, although I can\\'t remember her name, was super sweet! She was personable and offered some really great appetizers and drinks. What I really liked about her was her efficiency! We had a 13 person party and she was still on it! Our food came out hot and ready in record time! For our apps, drinks and meals, here\\'s what we had:\\n\\nChateau Laronde Desormes Bordeaux for $54 a bottle - This wine was on point! It was soft with a sweet finish. Definitely an everyday kind of Bordeaux, something you can drink all the time. This wine went great with my meal!\\n\\nWarm Brie Cheese for $12.95 - Served with black pepper honey, garlic, hazelnuts, croutons and greens. I love brie. This combination was no different. Whole cloves of roasted garlic enhanced the flavor of the cheese very well. \\n\\nChicken Liver Mousse Pate for $11.95 - First time trying this.  THE BEST THING I HAD THAT NIGHT! Served with burgundy red wine mustard and toast brioche with a garnish of gherkins and olives. The burgundy mustard brought a spicy/tangy element and the mouse was so rich and divine. This is MUST TRY, so delicious!\\n\\nBaked Goat Cheese for $11.95 - Another great dish. Tomato sauce surrounded the cheese with herb garlic bread. The cheese was super creamy and went well with the tomato profile. \\n\\nSeafood Platter for $49.95 - What a platter! Stuffed with shrimp, oysters and lobsters, this dish offered a little bit of everything for everyone! There were various dipping sauces and it was all served over ice. \\n\\nBone in Ribeye for $39.95 - This was my actual dinner. 22oz cut of steak, PERFECTLY cooked to my temperature, served with a bearnaise sauce and their signature hand cut fries. The steak was delicious. The right amount of marbleized meat, perfectly seasoned and packed with flavor and juices. AH-MAZE-ING. The bearnaise sauce was definitely not needed but offered another element. The fries were flat and super crispy. Really helped to break up the meat with a crunchy aspect. \\n\\nWhat a meal! This place has got to be one of the best upscale restaurants I\\'ve tried here in Vegas. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for an amazing date night restaurant, team building dinner joint or event a place that serves THE BEST pate! I will for sure be back, time and time again.  Thank you so much, Mon Ami Gabi, for making this evening one that I\\'ll never forget!',\n",

Between the outdoor deck (with heat lamps, so it can be enjoyed year round) that allows for fountain and people watching, the impeccable service, and... did I mention the food?

HUGE hunks of chocolate, with an orange glaze, on a soft cakey dough.  It's amazing.\\n\\nThere aren't really any cons I'd give this place other than: \\nBe aware that their breakfast ends at 11, which is earlier than some Vegas spots.

However, there was something wrong with the server. He was not all quite there, twitching, blinking, stuttering, bumping into the backs of our chairs, etc. We received our frites and entrees not long after we placed the order; however, the soup never showed up. We asked the server about it and he was so confused. So we just cancelled the soup as we didn't want to wait.  \\n\\nFood was okay, nothing special. The frites and scallops were so salty even though they were cooked pretty well. The frites also looked and tasted like the scraps left at the bottom of the pan, brown, over fried crumbs.  The excessive amount of salt totally ruined the dishes. Steelhead was tasty, but we realized that it's 28 bucks when we got the check. It's pretty costly compared to most of the entrees on the menu (average $19-$24). \\n\\nDefinitely not worth going back again for the food and service. For the view? Maybe. How disappointing!\",\n",

She did not care for the salad bc she is young and the vinaigrette dressing was so strong (I loved it) so I got online to look for a restaurant that would cater to children better.  I ended up seeing on google the children's menu for mon ami. Really? Why on earth wouldn't you OFFER the menu when I'm sitting with a 9 yr old and I was asking twenty questions about seasoning etc to make the meal kid friendly.

I didn't even think anything of it until more was discovered.\\nThe food came out VERY quickly which I was happy about BUT what I wasn't happy about was finding a black hair in my eggs benedict....I know it wasn't my hair cause Im very very blonde....\\nI didn't even touch that egg, the other egg was delicious.\\nMy bf took a sip of his coffee and felt something weird on his tongue, he took it out and low and behold it was skin. We found more of it inside the coffee.\\nSo after that we asked for the check and left.\\nI will NEVER go back there.\\n-Dirty cup\\n- Hair in food\\n- skin in coffee\\n\\nGROSS.\",\n",
       " 'DW and I dined 10/26.  She ordered sea bass, I had Filet Au Poivre frites.  Entrees were outstanding.  Another plus, we were seated in the cafe section indoors, but with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains.  Service was spot on.  I consider Mon Ami Gabi to be a very good value for a restaurant on the strip.\\n\\nOverall a very enjoyable meal on the strip.',\n",
       " 'How do people view French food?  \"Bread and wine\", \"Snails\", and \"I don\\'t know, all I know are French Fries\" are the popular answers in America, but after you try this place out there is no other answer but delicious.  We have eaten the escargot, the French onion soup, the Filet Mignon, the Sirloin, and drank some wine.  \\n\\nLet me start with the appetizers.  The escargot and the French onion soup was delightful.  It was my first time trying the escargot, and it was sublime!  There is a sort of cheesy texture to it; not what I had expected, but it was very good.  The French onion soup was the best I have ever had.  Most French onion soups are (in one word) salty.  Very little salt taste in this one, but the cheese inside this soup makes up for the absence sodium.  Very creative and very good.  If you have not tried their escargot or French onion soup, I suggest you try these two when trying this restaurant.\\n\\nThe bread and butter that came with the meal was great.  Real French style bread and the butter which melted on the bread upon contact was wonderful.  Their wine selection was adequate.  I had myself a Bordeaux and the misses had a Nutty Russian.  The wine was a great compliment to the bread and butter and later the steaks, but the Nutty Russian had too much alcohol for a mixed drink to my taste.  \\n\\nNow the main dishes: the steaks!  Let me start by saying the Filet Mignon here is now my personal standard for all Filet Mignons.  The beef steak cut literally like butter!  I had ordered it medium rare (how steak should be eaten).  The moment I bit into a piece of that steak, my mouth was filled with an over joyous sensation that can not be put into words.  You just have to try it for yourself.  The misses\\' Sirloin was good, but it was nothing compared to my steak.  \\n\\nThe service here is great.  The waitress made us feel as if we were good friends.  Great conversation, did not feel rushed, and made our experience all the better.  The food came out on time, and when something was late like our appetizers, she explained why in full detail; without us asking.  This shows punctuality on her part.  \\n\\nThis is definitely one place I am coming back to eat in when I am in Vegas again.  Not just being the best French restaurant, but let\\'s name this place a great steakhouse too, if not just for it\\'s Filet Mignon.  Cheers everyone and happy yelping!!',\n",

       " \"Yum! \\n\\nTo start, I had a really well made cosmo and you'd be surprised how easy it is to screw up a cosmo. We were off to a good start. \\n\\nThe bread they serve is delicious- real, fresh, french bread. \\n\\nFor dinner, I ordered the scallops which were served with a puree of root veggies and brussel sprouts. It was outstanding. \\n\\nService was wonderful from start to finish.\\n\\nI would return in a heartbeat.\",\n",

The chicken was mouthwateringly moist with a crispy skin. The mashed potato side was creamy and delicious and the accompanying bacon, onion, and mushroom mix was perfectly done as well.\\n\\nBut my onion soup was a huge disappointment. The flavor had a bitter aftertaste and the gyuere cheese on top was already sunken into the soup, leaving it a gloppy mess instead of a crisp crust. Definitely not worth $10.\\n\\nOverall, it was a good experience with a wonderful view as well, but skip the onion soup!',\n",
       " \"I love this place! This is the first restaurant that we visited in Vegas and it was a great start to our blessed weekend. We visited during the lunch time but they were already very busy. We didn't have the reservation but they sat us down quickly. It was a big restaurant with traditional European decorations. We started out with drinks. I enjoyed my Frangria while my friend was served with their bloody mary bar. Our first plate was the mussels, which was cooked in a creamy and rich sauce. It was perfect! Definitely one of the best mussels that I have had. It was followed by my main entree, chicken and mushroom crepe. The crepe was also excellent. The filling of mushroom and chicken was well balanced with the light creamy sauce. The crepe was thin but flavorful. Overall, we all enjoyed our plates and were ready for our Vegas trip. The location of this place is also a selling point. It is right across from the fountain of Bellagio. If you come during the late afternoon or evening, you can enjoy their famous fountain show right from the restaurant.\",\n",

Views of the Belaggio fountains were an extra bonus. Mandy the server took very good care of us.\",\n",
       " \"It was me and my boyfriends 2 Year Anniversary, and we wanted to something fun to celebrate. Naturally we went to VEGAS! We wanted to have a nice romantic dinner, I had searched and found Mon Ami. It had great reviews so I went with it. I got reserverations and thank God I did! It was pretty packed. We had shown up 10 minutes late and there was a line, they seated us right away and asked if it was our first time there. They explained all the fancy lingo on the menu and told us what we should try if we were feeling adventurous. The prices are pretty pricey, but hey it's our anniversary. My b/f got the Filet Mingon marinated in Merlot. I got the Herb Chicken. Man OH Man! It was the MOST DELICIOUS MEAL I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE! I was so glad I picked this place. It was 110%  WORTH EVERY EXPENSIVE PENNY!\",\n",
       " \"This place is great!!! We had a group of 5 on a Saturday and didn't have to wait for a table. Service was impeccable. All of our questioned were answered with grace and we didn't have to wait too long for anything. One small thing that I think rarely gets praised is that our water glasses remained filled without the waiter being too obtrusive. I also really appreciated that our group was decked out in sweaty t-shirts and shorts after walking up and down the strip in the hot Vegas summer, and yet still received service free of snide looks and judgment.\\n\\nI got the 22oz bone-in ribeye and boy was that thing juicy and flavorful. I like my steaks to have a slight chew followed by a give into mouth watering goodness. The whole time I was watching my friend's reaction as he was eating the same thing and we couldn't stop smiling. These babies are also cooked on a grill the whole way through, instead of a pan and oven, so you get a nice hit of char and smoke as you bite through the crust.\\n\\nI'm never a big fan of steak fries so the smaller fries were really crunchy and seasoned just right. Top that off with some profiteroles stuffed with vanilla bean ice cream and a dark chocolate sauce and you have a dinner that will be hard to forget.\\n\\nI'm nitpicking but one small complaint is I ordered a Boulvardier as an aperitif and it was pretty average. Stick with wine and you'll be solid.\\n\\nDefinitely a place I'll return to and recommend for future visits in Vegas.\",\n",
       " \"Great location for people watching, right along the strip. The food wasn't anything special. It tasted good but was still mediocre. The hostess was unwelcoming and service pretty bad. Overall a decent place to go, but mostly thanks to the location and super cozy interior.\",\n",

I know I can't add much to what has already been said but my son and I found this restaurant so good we ate here three times in a short two day stay in Vegas- it was in our hotel, the Paris, and it was great every time we ate here.  Service was always excellent,  our most exceptional server was Tracy at breakfast.   I doubt that you would find service as good or friendly in a real French restaurant in Paris. \\n\\nFrench restaurants I've found have always been a little too much on the pretentious side for my taste but this one really serves some exceptional fare with a distinct French twist.  The Croque Madame for breakfast was really good.  The fries were always exceptional, for breakfast and with steaks at night.  The French Onion soup was really well done.   The scallop appetizer done au gratin was one of the best scallop dishes I've ever tasted.   The restaurant has a warm and very comfortable bistro feel to it and I would recommend it highly.\\n\\nThe patio outside has a million dollar view of the Bellagio water show across the street so there is usually a wait for tables outside.  We never experienced any major delay in seating for an inside table.\",\n",

I had their bone-in rib-eye steak which was done to perfection.  Other family members had the filet mignon, pork tenderloin and trout special were also great.  Their escargot was a bit of a disappointment.  The meat was small although it is somewhat buttery and savorful.  Be aware there will be a mandatory 18% tip on your bill...I guess that\\'s part of eating at a \"fancy\" place.  Overall, great for a first time experience but not planning to come back.',\n",
       " \"I don't know what they put in the coffee here, but it was the one of the best I've ever had.  Or maybe I was hungover.  I was in Vegas for a 4 day buddy's bachelor party extravaganza.  I did eat here for 3 straight days for breakfast (at 2pm).  I tried everything from the Eggs & Beef Bourguignon to Salmon Eggs Benedict.  The food was awesome.  My only complaint was that the pitchers of orange juice was ridiculously expensive.  The 4 pitchers of the orange juice was about 33% of the bill for 6-8 people.  Otherwise, the food price wasn't too outrageous.  The orange juice was phenomenal but not worth the price though.  We always sat on the outdoor patio with a great view of the Bellagio fountain.  The service was somewhat slow, but I'll give them slack because this place was always busy.  At least the servers were always super nice.\",\n",

The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and she loved their fries.   Their GF trout dish was also excellent.\\n\\nWe had two breakfasts there.   They don't have a dedicated GF breakfast menu, but they have quite a few gf options, including gluten free waffles and French Toast.\\n\\nThe GF Waffle was very good, but we expected that, as we had great GF waffles at lots of places.

He was very accomodating & was even able to confirm that the one of the specials of the day was gluten free (it was a grilled porkchop with a mustard butter sauce with their frites & was fantastically delicious). My bf got the steak bearnaise, which also happens to be gluten free, so I was able to enjoy his as well. Both of our meals were fantastic! I also got to enjoy warm slices of gluten free bread & butter before my meal. And we shared the flourless chocolate cake for dessert & it was to die for.

       " \"Mon Ami Gabi, what a popular place for Las Vegas visitors.  I was informed about the place on recommendation from my sister.  Many people pass by the place and see the outdoor patio and think to visit the location.  They have also many other locations throughout America which might also give them some word of mouth.  Reservations were made on Open Table with request to be seated indoors as close to the windows as possible to view the Bellagio fountains.  Reservations were for 7, arrived at 640 and was immediately seated at the table requested.  I'm gonna take more advantage of Open Table from now on specifically because of this!\\n\\nThe place has a dark romantic atmosphere, a little loud but still nice.  The rustic french feel added to the ambiance.  For food, I had the mussels marinere while K had the steak au poivre.  I regret not going for a steak.  Mon Ami Gabi is well known for their steaks and it seemed like many people in the restaurant either had some kind of steak of the mussels.  The mussels themselves were very big, hearty mussels but the flavor of the broth wasn't as infused as I'd like.  On top of that, the frites that Mon Ami serves were basically deep fried potato chips.  They were insanely thin and had not meat to them to give that starchy flavor to balance whatever  you are eating.  K had the steak which was tender and yummy with the sauce that was poured on top, for $25, this was a pretty good deal for right on the strip\\n\\nFor desert, bananas foster crepe with vanilla ice and creme fraiche.  Great desert, with the perfect mix of the banana foster mixed with a crepe.\\n\\n-1 star for the service: our waiter was a little creepy, awkward and talked to us strangely, his timing was really off\\n\\nOverall, an immensely popular restaurant that I wouldn't attempt to revisit without a reservation, a good spot for a reasonably priced steak on the strip with a great view of the Bellagio fountains.\",\n",
       " 'I really liked Mon Ami Gabi and based on my experience would probably give them 4 and a half stars. Prices are a little high, perhaps,  but not outrageous. \\n\\nWe sat at the bar and the service was really good. Got here around 5:15 and it was busy but not crazy. By the time we left a bit after 7 it was packed. Ordered the steak frites with the hanger steak and merlot butter. The butter was sweeter than I expected it to be but it was pretty nice. Steak was perfectly cooked and flavorful and tender. The fries were really delicious also- crispy and nicely seasoned. I also had a manhattan and the \"frangria\" (sangria really), both were good and had a nice pour. The loaf of bread served with meal was AMAZING- hot and crusty on the outside, soft on the inside and truly yummy. They also gave a dish of shredded (?) carrots with the bread. I\\'m not normally a fan of raw carrots but this was fantastic and I really enjoyed it. \\n\\nI\\'m a bit torn between 4 and 5 stars because I did enjoy my food a lot and the service was quite good as well. I do think the prices are maybe a tad too high, particularly on the drinks, and since I only had one thing on the menu, I\\'ll stick to 4 for now.

I ended up with a cut on my leg that was bleeding for several minutes as they sent a manager over. I told them I was fine, which I was. However, I found it a bit disappointing that  my calm response was met with no offer to make it right. Especially when they offered a discount after simply bringing someone the wrong entree. After all, if I had made a big deal out of it, they probably would have at least offered to discount the bill. Seems like only bad behavior is rewarded these days.\",\n",

I made reservations for a group of 7 and we were seated within 15 minutes  at  round table in the corner.  It was the perfect spot!  when you look up, the celings are so high and the hanging lamps were very rustic looking! I loved that they sat us at a round table.  I hate when you have a large group and they seat you in a rectangle shaped table where you have to lean forward to talk or look at the person you are talking to.  \\n\\nFOOD:\\nWe started with the Country pate which was too course for my palate.  We were deciding between the Country or the Mousse, but we all thought the mousse would be too moussey ( is that a word?).  the flavor was spot on, however i would of liked the texture a little smoother.  It was hard to spread on the break because, well it doesn't really spread!\\n\\nThe Escargots were very tasty and even better when you ask for extra bread and dip it in the left over garlic pesto sauce.  \\n\\nI think we asked for bread 3 times, and i over heard our waiter say to another waiter, they want MORE bread???  haha. Yes we like our french bread, is that a crime?  \\n\\nI ordered soup du jour which happened to be cream of garlic.  Could this be a better match for me?  I happen to love garlic so of course i had to order the soup.  It was so good that my two friends sitting on either side of me kept dipping their bread in my bowl!  I was happy to share... they gave such a huge bowl!\\n\\nFor my entree i decided to go with the scallops gratin which was an appetizer, but by the time this arrived, I was already so full!  The scallops were VERY flavorful.  In every bite you can taste the caramelized onion, Gruyere, Parmesan, and garlic.  You however, don't really taste the scallops at all.  This is definitely an appetizer to share.  Eating four of these bad boys will leave our mouth thirsty for water the whole night!  this is definitly my kinda dish as i love all these flavors, but maybe one would suffice! =P\\n\\nI tried a few of the other dishes, seared scallops ( it was very fishy and very scallopy.  I would give this dish 2 *.), steak with herbed butter ( the steak was kinda thin and tough 3*).  \\n\\nOverall, the experience, ambiance, and food was pretty good.

Great atmosphere & decor..warm and inviting, with tables outside, tables in a glass atrium setting with views of outside, and a regular dining room. It is very loud (as most bistros are) and can get quite dark (I saw plenty of people using their cell phones to light up the menu. C'est la vie!\\nHowever some may tell you to sit outside and enjoy the views of the Bellagio's Fountains, but the view is not that good with all the pedestrians and car traffic on the Strip.\\nTHE FOOD\\nApps--\\n--Coquille st Jacques ( a special)  was an excellent choice. Cooked to perfection!\\nA King Scallop prepared with wine, butter, cream, mushrooms, cheese and breadcrumbs.\\nOne of my favorite French dishes. \\n--WILD ESCARGOTS DE BOURGOGNE--oven-roasted snails, garlic-herb butter with puff pastry top were an excellent rendition of the classic French dish.\\n--HANDMADE BURRATA CHEESE with olive tapenade, toasted baguette was good , but I've had better at Italian restaurants.\\n--SCALLOPS GRATINÉES--fennel-onion-mussel cream was awesome!\\nWe also decided to try the Chicken liver mousse pate' over the Country pate' on the recommendation of our waitress and it was just so-so (to later find out that they had Foie Gras !!! which we would have eagerly ordered.

So I asked on the OpenTable reservation service if they could make an exception. I also asked if they could make sure we had a nice table in the glass atrium area.\\nWhen i mentioned to the waitress that it was a birthday and to bring a dessert with a candle on it , she replied I know all about it ...I saw the book of instructions we needed to follow.....Well FU....\\n\\n3- I made a comment to the waitress after dinner (since the pate' we ordered was so-so) that I was surprised not to see foie gras on the menu. She told me they had it. That the chef does make a bunch of specials that she did not mention when she told us the 3  specials for that night.\\nWhat do they save certain specials for regulars? or if they ask...totally stupid.\\nI stopped right there because I didn't; want to get aggravated.\\nIt's a good thing they added a 18% tip for a party of six or more. She would have gotten less if I had a choice.\\n\\nDo NOT let this keep you from MAG. It is definitely one of the better restaurants on the Strip and I'd probably go back again.\",\n",
       " \"I've probably walked by this place a dozen times, and always thought about trying out the food, but generally got dissuaded by the super long lines during the spring, summer and fall. During Christmas week at 5pm however, the place was a ghost town so we were able to be seated right away.  The first thing you notice right away the awesome views of the Bellagio fountains. We opted to sit inside vs outside considering it was around 40F outside but we did notice some brave souls bundled up on the patio.\\nMenu is a great classic american-french menu. We decided to start with the chicken liver mousse and duck confit. Both came out quick and were prepared perfectly. For our mains, everyone but me ordered the rack of lamb special while I got the full order of mussels. It did take a little long for our dishes to come out, however during the entire time the manager and our server were always keeping us up to date. The apologized over the fact that the standard time was 22min and it had been 32min since they had to re-start one of the lamb dishes.. We all were happily enjoying our wine and it was really no big deal, but we appreciated their attention to detail.\\nOnce our food did come out, we all were blown away with just how great each of our dishes were (well except for one person)\\nMy mussels were cooked perfectly, almost all of them had popped open , and the broth was rich extremely flavorful. Like other people have mentioned, the fries are sliced flat which gives them a unique texture.  \\nMy friends all really enjoyed their lamb, they were done just right, not too tough and not undercooked. As for the one person in our party who thought their lamb was overcooked, that problem was easily taken care of by our manager and server. It was whisked away and replaced by filet mignon.\\nTo wrap up the night we got the creme brulee and chocolate mousse.  If you're a chocolate fan, I would highly suggest the mousse. Its rich, but not overwhelmingly rich in chocolate. It's topped with dozens of little chocolate balls which gives a satisfying crunch with every bite of the mousse. The creme brulee had the perfectly caramelized sugar top with a smooth and silky custard underneath. \\nFor the biggest surprise of the night, when the bill came the lamb, filet mignon, and the desserts were all taken off our bill!\\nOutstanding food and service and definitely on our list of places to come to again.\",\n",

I've had several entrees and desserts on the menu, and each item was amazing.  It's a little spendy, which is to be expected for any restaurant on the strip, but if you can manage to get an outdoor seat it's well worth it.  The seating is elevated from the strip, so it isn't like you have people walking by and sticking their heads in to have a look at your meal.  I would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a nice and memorable meal on the Strip.\",\n",

Their moules frites and steak frites are delicious.  Their cocktails are awesome too but if you don't drink, fret not, you'll also walk out french fries wasted since almost every entree comes with fries lolz.

I had the classique steak with asparagus (my hubby ordered the mushrooms and we split sides). My kids had the burger (it came kinda rare for a kid meal) and the Mac and cheese.  He said it was too cheesy (blasphemy!).  It was white cheddar shells (like Panera) but not saucy.  You could see the melted shreds of cheese in it.  Both kid meals came with thinly sliced granny apple slices and green beans.\\n\\nThe steak was wonderful.  I actually think the green beans were the best side (I stole all of it off my kid's plate.). For sure will get those next time. We sat just inside from the patio.  We had a great view of the Bellagio fountains and folks walking by.  At about 6pm, the sun sets behind Bellagio so you are fine dining on the patio at after that time.  I heard a hostess tell another couple that they get busiest between 7 and 10 pm as they walked by our table.  We also had the creme brûlée for dessert.  A little too much lemon for my taste and it needed a side of berries or something.  (I know, I know, it's still creme brûlée!)\\n\\nThe only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because our waitress disappeared midway through dinner and we had to ask a hostess for more iced tea.  Seriously, it was my last resort since I was so thirsty.  I was looking around for her when my glass was half full (or empty) and she never appeared until it was totally empty.

I will say I was quite disappointed.  They were not the juicy, medium rare, fresh off the grill steak strips I got in the past.  It tasted like a warm beef sandwich you could order at any hot deli.  Certainly not $18 worth and not what I expect from Mon Ami Gabi.  On the other hand, my wife got the Warm Chicken and Brie sandwich was was surprisingly tasty.  The spread was just off the hook.  An entirely disappointing experience was luckily spared by my wife selflessly trading half her sandwich for mine.

We were seated promptly on the patio, right under a strong current of cold air from the A/C.  Nice ambiance, though a bit noisy.  Our waiter was very friendly, enjoyable and fairly attentive.  The food was a disappointment.  We all had the Special Eggs Benedict, that sounded nice; for a small premium over the regular Benedict (which comes with bacon), you get no bacon, but instead a slice of avocado and a slice of heirloom tomato, plus chives in the Hollandaise sauce.  So we tried it and ordered a side of date-glazed bacon.  How many slices?  It depends on the slice size, maybe 2 or maybe 3 - we were fortunate to get 3 slices and it was delicious, perfectly cooked.  The avocado was quite thin, the tomato had no flavor, one of the eggs was broken and the Hollandaise sauce was not as good as the instant sauce we often use at home.  The coffee was good.  It is ideally situated in the heart of the Strip and a good place to meet friends if you don\\'t care much about the food.  It would be far more impressive at night if you score a patio seat where you can enjoy the lighted Bellagio fountain display.',\n",

I had the steak au poivre with brandy peppercorn sauce which was decent but if I go back, I'll have to try the filet mignon with merlot butter, which is supposed to be their signature steak.  The sides were good, I recommend the garlic spinach.  They also have a pretty expansive wine list, which is a must for a french steakhouse.  The only downside was that they were out of a lot of dishes, including the dessert that we wanted!  We had an 8:15 reservation, so they shouldn't be running out of things that early on.\",\n",

I would recommend making a reservation from OpenTable.com and then showing up a little early and letting the hostess know you're willing to wait for a table outside- SO worth it. Even if it's cold outside they have heaters that will keep you warm. The service is impeccable, the food is delicious, and you can't beat the view. For breakfast I had the eggs benedict which were cooked perfectly. I also had some of the coffee which was delicious & seriously the second I finished a cup the waitress was back to pour me a fresh one. For lunch, BEST FRENCH ONION SOUP OF MY LIFE. HANDS DOWN. I swear heaven opened up and the angels started singing as soon as I poked my spoon through the massive layer of cheese into that delicious broth. And - $7.50 glass of chardonnay. That is unheard of along the Strip, at least to my knowledge of any decent restaurant. Usually you are paying $10-12+ for a glass.

All the steaks come with a HUGE pile of frites. Those were the best part of the meal, hands down. Think of them like the amazing marriage between potato chips and french fries. The perfect combination of crispy/soft.\\n\\nI also recommend the Metropolitan (fruity and fizzy), but my friend got a cocktail that straight up tasted like Tylenol cough syrup.

The steak sandwich was served with frites and a side of ketchup (lol) but our waitress was more than happy to supply us with their very good housemade aioli when I requested it.

The service by staff was very good.  The ambience of a bistro French restaurant was very nice.  We asked if we could substitute french fries for the gnocchi served with the short rib...no problem...  The salad was very good, the French bread was warm & in a bag, but they did not switch the gnocchi for the fries which was requested.  They were very gracious and said...no worry...we will give you an order of fries on the side.  Cool! The main issue was that the short rib daily special was very dry and tough...must have been braised/baked earlier in the day and saved until all servings were sold.  Surface was charred,  but was covered with sauce and mushrooms which were flavorful. Mentioned to the server that the shortribs were dry and tough...response was that's the way it is prepared. I have had short ribs at many restaurants...this was the worse and most expensive. The price of the total meal which was shared with my wife was $89.83...including tip which I should have omitted.  Without tip, it was $77.83.  Not a good value...not a good meal.  But...that was Vegas...pricey...and not always good quality. Best to NOT have short ribs on Thursday special, or to make very clear to your  server... exactly how you want your dish to be prepared...\",\n",

We definitely weren't rushed or anything, but all our courses came out at lightning speed, and considering how fast we devoured all the frenchy goodness, we were only there for an hour or so. \\n\\nAfter being promptly seated for our dinner reservation, we started with the french onion soup. I'm not that much of a soup guy, but how can you eat at a French restaurant without ordering multiple courses, and ensuring that the majority include an alarming amount of cheese, butter, or other source of saturated fat?? There must have been about 5 lbs. of gruyere on that bad boy, but wow, was it delish. Next courses: trout grenoblaise (sp?) and filet mignon. The trout was the perfect portion, perfectly seasoned, and not too heavy, although I didn't care too much for the accompanying potatoes. BF's filet was decent, but the horseradish sauce on top really made it melt in your mouth. Up next: creme brulee. I don't think I've had enough creme brulee to discern the quality of this particular one, but BF said it was really good.\\n\\nOverall, a great place if you want to eat on the Strip while not going broke that offers great, but not amazing, fare. I really wish we had sat on the patio bc it's right across from the Bellagio fountains. If you go, take time to ENJOY your food and don't inhale it like voracious pigs.

Okay, maybe not the best, but it was pretty dang good.\\n\\nI decided to order the Chicken and Mushroom Crepe topped with kale and brie.  A very hearty portion, and super satisfying.

Everything went well together, and all ingredients had a perfect balance.\\n\\nMy husband got the Classique Steak Frites with maitre d' butter.  His hangar steak was cooked perfectly, and the frites were something special.  We've seen many frites entrees that looked like they opened up a bag of frozen french fries and threw in the deep fryer.  But these were like a chip/fry hybrid.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Definitely homemade, or if not, they chose a wonderfully unique product.\\n\\nI recommend Mon Ami Gabi with two thumbs up.

       " \"Wow! That is one of the best French restaurants I've ever been to (including a few in Paris). Everything was top-notch! We had a lovely lunch there and it's all thanks to you, dear yelp users! I researched few places nearby and Mon Ami Gabi had so many good reviews that I decided on trying it right away. \\n\\nFirst impression - this place is enormous! We wanted to sit on a patio and to get there we went trough three or four different dining rooms. The view outside is great, as the restaurant is facing Bellagio and its beautiful fountains. The staff was very nice and organized, we were promptly seated and handed menus. A lot of dishes seemed appetizing so it took a while to order. \\n\\nFor a starter we shared goat cheese and snails in garlic, butter and herbs. Both were simply delicious! Escargot were best I ever had and goat cheese came with creamy tomato sauce and fresh and crispy baguette. Mmm... Next we all ordered onion soup. It was very nicely prepared, with the melted cheese on the top. I don't know why I ordered it as I absolutely hate french onion soup. It must have been peer pressure :D. However, it was still one of the most passable onion soups I ate. And others like it very much, so it's probably great. After the first course we were already pretty full, but we made a mistake of ordering everything at once, so a few minutes later spinach and salmon salad with walnuts and blueberries arrived before me. And it was a surprising dish. In my opinion a salmon salad always consist of lots of small salmon pieces, not one big hunk of fish and all the other stuff next to it. It was more of the size of the main course and should have been named 'salmon and salad' not 'salmon salad'. But it's all semantics. Walnuts and blueberries gave the dish a refreshing taste, and even though I didn't manage to finish it, it was still very tasty. Our friends decided on salmon tatar with chips and it was probably the weakest part of the meal, but still not bad. It just lacked some herbs or spices. During our visit we also drank a lot of lemonade. At the beginning I made a mistake of ordering home made tea. In Poland, where I live, it always taste sweet, however, as I quickly learned, in America it's just regular tea, only cold. It did not taste good. The waiter was so nice, that upon noticing my mistake, she proposed switching it for sweet lemonade right away. And she didn't even put the tea on the bill. \\n\\nWe left the place full and content. Looking back, it was probably one of the best restaurants I visited during the stay. Definitely recommend.\",\n",

Plus, it was Dec. 18th, which I guess is historically one of the slowest times in Vegas.  Anyway, our server went ahead and gave some recommendations for entrees and man, am I glad I went with his suggestions!  My husband and I both ordered the filet with Merlot butter reduction.  I am not even joking, this is most likely the best meal I have ever had in my life.  The filet was PERFECT.  Super tender, moist, and absolutely delicious when coupled with the merlot sauce!  The super thin fries are really interesting.  We also shared a plate of garlic spinach (which, btw, was definitely big enough for 2 to share) which was quite tasty.  For dessert, we got the chocolate mousse which was also excellent!  The service was great.  Our server offered for us to have a taste of the wine we were considering buying a bottle of....and that was indeed a great idea since we liked it a lot and bought the bottle.  \\n\\nAmbiance is very nice and you can't beat an evening view of the Bellagio fountains!  We sat inside right by the window.  We couldn't hear the music when the fountain show was on, but oh well.  That's a very minor drawback.  \\n\\nOverall, it was absolutely fabulous.

       " 'The steak is the restaurant specialty and the best and the scallop was really good. The goat meat was not good as hope. The restaurant is warm and welcome. The restaurant is inside the casino and the Eiffel Tower is above it.',\n",
       " \"Yummy! Came here with my husband a few months back for our anniversary. We loved the food and service! Their fresh baked complimentary French bread is delicious! There was absolutely nothing negative to mention about this place. It was not the very best french food I have had, but definitely up there.\\n\\nThey're a bit pricey but I assure you the cost is well worth it. Nice ambiance and great customer service.\",\n",
       " 'Service was amazing. Our server was very familiar with the dining and wine menu. Very helpful in making a selection. I enjoyed the steak with the blue cheese along with the asparagus. Dinner was great. Loved the fresh bread and shredded carrots served before our dinner arrived. Great dining experience and we were a large party of about 16 and still had a great experience.',\n",
       " \"I made a reservation on opentable.com before we got there.  Total lifesaver.  The line was WELL out the door when we arrived for our 6:30pm reservation.  We were sat inside, the patio was full.  \\n\\n*Warm Olive Jar- $6.95- delish!  The olives had so much flavor and I used the garlic on the bread!\\n\\n*Shrimp Cocktail- $14.95- a little pricy but they were 3 bite shrimp...they were HUGE\\n\\n*French Onion Soup- $8.95- not as salty as I thought it was going to be.  Very good.\\n\\n*Filet with Merlot Sauce- $32.95- melt in your mouth delicious.  I was super bummed when it was gone.\\n\\n*Fries- A little odd but they were very good soaked in the merlot sauce.\\n\\nVery Very Very good.  The service here is excellent and the bread is to die for.  Will be back next time I'm in Vegas.\",\n",
       " \"Great restaurant, good food at a reasonable price (for the strip), and an absolutely prime location for people watching.  We go several times a year, and it is very consistent in both food and service.  Then only reason I don't give a 5th star is because they will not let you reserve an outside table.  The ambiance outside is fun and lively, but inside is like a different restaurant, and much less upbeat.  You roll the dice a little when you make a reservation.  We now only go on spec, and if the outside or conservatory is full, go somewhere else and come back another time.\",\n",

We mainly focused on the seafood section and was left disappointed. \\n\\n*Food*\\n- Escargot: so savory and went perfectly with the bread they provided!\\n\\n- Eggs Benedict: I was a little disappointed with this dish, the ones I had back home at a diner was better. Portion size was small, just an egg over a sad soggy English muffin. \\n\\n- Baked Scallop: 3 scallops baked to perfection and the sauce went perfect with the bread.\\n\\n- Seafood Crepe: another disappointing dish, nothing to break the seafood and creme combination, so you get tired of the taste after 5 bites. \\n\\n- Mussels: DO NO ORDER. They were NOT fresh mussels. We even told the waitress about it and she said the they have fresh ones daily. Not true, 1 taste and you know it has been sitting there for days.\\n\\nWe had some amazing seafood the day before at L'Atelier de Bouchon where we felt like we were eating right out of the ocean, but the mussels we had felt like they got them from the gutter. Disappointing way to end our meal. \\n\\n* Service *\\n- Our waitress was polite enough, although her demeanor did not seem genuine. Overall it was fine, we got our bread and water fast enough.\",\n",

The service overall was just amazing, every time I took a sip of my water before I knew it someone already refilled it. The server was very attentive and informative and didn't seem to mind the fact that my boyfriend and I were aiming to spend very little (college budget). He didn't seem to mind at all thankfully. For the price, you are definitely getting your moneys worth here, plus the food is great (definitely coming back to reorder the mussels).\",\n",

We had a party of 13, and were seated in the best part of the restaurant (the back room by the patio...tons of sunshine and warm on cold day).  We were also out of the way of heavy traffic.\\n\\nAlthough the restaurant was packed due to Memorial Day weekend, our server was so amazing.  Yes, they forgot to bring syrup with the waffles and extra berries with the crepes, but the food was outstanding and they responded quickly to our needs.\\n\\nThe breakfast menu was large with many different types of options.  They definitely had something for everyone.  I had the crab cake benedict ($16) and my eggs were perfectly poached.  My friends loved both the savory and sweet crepes and everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered. \\n\\nI would definitely recommend making reservations.  We finished up around 12 noon and there was a long line on our way out.  We made our reservation 2 months in advance (due to the large party/holiday weekend), and when I tried to make a small change two weeks before, they were unable to accommodate, but we still had a great time!\",\n",
       " \"Really enjoyed it here, during lunch they seat people in one area and it was really condensed but I didn't mind I really relished in the view of the strip. Our waitress was super friendly and catered to our needs. The filet mignon was yummy but a bit dry for a medium well, but overall the experience was lovely. Will be coming back here for special occasions.\",\n",
       " \"I have all the best things to say about the food and service here, but I will keep it brief. \\n\\nTo start, you'll get a fresh loaf of French bread with whipped butter while you drool over their menu.\\n\\nThe French Onion Soup was rich and cheesy as it should be.\\n\\nI'm not usually big on pate, but I truly enjoyed the Chicken Liver Pate. It was rich and smooth, but not gamy, and not gelatinous. \\n\\nThe Mussels were big and juicy, and the white wine sauce/broth was perfect medium for the French bread.\\n\\nFinally, we had the Prime Steak Au Poivre--we asked for it with mashed potatoes--and it was incredible! Perfectly medium rare as we requested, so tender, and just the right amount of peppercorn.\\n\\nI would recommend making a reservation. Oh, and as a bonus, their portion sizes are definitely more in line with American portions than French portions. :)\",\n",
       " 'Went for a late dinner on Friday night  (with reservations), and even though it was busy, service was great. We started with the mussels, which were the best I have ever had. I chose the wild boar ragu based on a suggestion from the server. Glad I took his suggestion, it was fantastic! Just a warning, it is very dimly lit in the restaurant, so be prepared if you go ar night, bit worth it!',\n",
       " \"I'm not really a fan of French food, but majority of my group wanted to eat here.  The food was pretty good, though it is kind of a scramble to find something more free of French influence.  I had the Chicken Paillard which was pretty good. If you sit on the patio, you have a perfect view of the Bellagio's fountain display as well.  Besides that I'm not a fan of French food, my only real issue was that I paid in cash and my waitress automatically assumed I did not want any change.  I asked her three times for change back over 30 minutes and she kept trying to tell me that she could only give me a certain amount back.\",\n",
       " \"Found this restaurant while walking down the strip in Vegas. Their menu looked good and was busy so we walked in to give it a chance. \\n\\nTheir service was amazing. Their fresh baked baguette was to die for. But unfortunately the food did not please us. The Niçoise salad was bland and missing flavor and their grilled cheese was cold and hard as a rock. They did handle our disappointment well so that's why I'm giving them four stars. \\n\\nI'm sure they have good food on their menu we just weren't happy with what we ordered.\",\n",

Location!\\n\\nStopped by for breakfast at 7:45 AM on a Sunday and although we had a reservation through Open Table, we likely didn't need one at that time.\\n\\nOur son had the waffles, my wife had Crepes, and I had the smoke salmon plate. \\n\\nThe food was fresh, high quality, and looked great. The taste was above average.\\n\\nThe main reason you'd eat here is for the LOCATION on the strip. Plenty of people watching and you're right in front of the Bellagio Fountains. It also gives you a break from the buffets. \\n\\nAlthough the place is casual, men can't wear tank tops or sleeveless shirts. No problem -- they gave me a plain white shirt (which look far worse in my opinion).\\n\\nOverall, A MUST to eat at this place when in Vegas!\",\n",

The plates and cups on the table were dusty and a little grimey. The food was not as tasty as previous visits. I have never been totally in love with the food, but it was always decent and the location and price point made it that much better. \\n\\nThe lobster roll was overly creamy and mayonnaise-y and the croque Monsieur was ok and probably the best dish of the meal. Our dining companion found a hair in their salad and it took a long time to get our server's attention to get that fixed. After that her replacement dish was slow to arrive. \\n\\nIt was a busy Sunday, so I understand that they were slower than usual but that didn't explain the dusty plates and glasses. \\n\\nIt's still a decent restaurant to visit to enoy the patio and view of the fountains, the food just isn't as good as it used to be.\",\n",

The French bread  wow!!\\n\\nMoreover, our server Georgie, who was beyond amazing , refreshingly real and fun w great recommendations! She's an expert and been here 16 years! She even sung her name to us! \\n\\nLast night we went to Del Monaco's, And they should be ashamed of themselves not even 1% of Mon Ami Gabi.\",\n",

It was almost too fancy and I felt a little underdressed. Not a casual dining spot. I give this place 5 stars and I will mention the only thing that wasn't fitting was the paper table cloth. C'etait fantastique!\",\n",

Waitress was very nice and friendly. That's about it for this restaurant.\\n\\nWe ordered the egg Florentine and croque madam. The Hollandaise sauce was bland and the English muffin was soggy. My croquet madam had a sad look. It was a small sandwich with a well done egg on top. The waitress told me the egg would be over easy when I ordered. But it came well done. It was quite bland too. Food was very disappointing. The quality of the food with the price we paid, it wasn't not worth it. If you are looking for a brunch place, stay away from here. \\n\\nBy the way, I thought the hostess wasn't very friendly either. There was no smile on her face at all. I felt sorry that she's to work that day.\",\n",

I've had much better steaks for less. \\n\\nOverall: Worth doing if you're in the area and wanting some decent food without worrying about a dress code. We had no problem getting a table at 6pm on a Monday, but on weekends you would want to get a reservation (easy to do online)\",\n",
       " 'This spot is one of my fave places to eat in Vegas. I took myself for Thanksgiving dinner last year, a bite during my birthday, and then most recently, a quick lunch while passing through town. The restaurant has a large interior, as well as a large patio--I honestly don\\'t know why people would want to eat anywhere except the patio, as it is prime seating for the fountains an for people watching!\\n\\nThe service has always been super friendly and the wine/cocktail list is great. On a more individual level, they are one of the BEST spots in Vegas for those of us with Celiac Disease! They take special care in the kitchen to keep things. They offer gluten free bread (for free) and I can even get French Onion Soup (such a rarity!) The last time, I took my BF and he had the regular menu, and was equally impressed. They also don\\'t seem to raise the prices, due to location or for adding any gluten free bread, etc.\\n\\nThis is a solid spot for me, any time I\"m in town.',\n",

       " \"There is nothing better than sitting outside with your girlfriends drinking champagne eating onion soup and watching the water show at the Bellagio as the afternoon goes by. This is the best patio in Las Vegas. Is it the best French food in the world? No, but hey we are not in Paris anyway. So go, immediately and sit outside on the patio or have brunch on Sunday under the Atrium. Even if you can only stop in for a drink at the bar facing the strip you will be glad you made the effort of finding it. That is a Parisian experience for sure!! \\nAnd in the more traditional event that you would like to eat dinner inside, that too is a romantic endeavor and one that will light your faces up by candlelight and be a beautiful dinner, I promise.\\nIf you would like to sit outside it is the only thing that a reservation is not good for. You must come and sign up as they do not hold tables for anyone. However sometimes I will admit to making a reservation, and then if the wait isn't that long canceling it to sit outside. I know it may be wrong, but you have to know how to work the system to get a good table!!!!!\",\n",
       " \"Mmmm...just looking at the pictures of the food we ordered still makes my tongue wag!\\n\\nFirst and foremost, I have got to thank all of the fellow yelpers for such an awesome find.  Everything was absolutely delish!\\n\\nReservations is a must for this place regardless when you eat here because it's always crowded and the wait is super duper long.  I made my reservation 2 weeks prior to my trip to Vegas for lunch at 12:30.  I have also requested outdoor patio seating but there's no guarantees with reservations, you would still have to wait.  The atrium room seating isn't bad at all.  On the afternoon that we went, it was crazy windy so trash was flying all over the place and onto people's food and into their cups. The atrium room is small but right up against the window behind the patio which if weather is permitting, you can definitely enjoy your food with the Bellagio water show without the wind or trash blowing all over the place.\\n\\nThe service was impeccable.  Our waitress was charming and had a great sense of humor.  She was super patient with us and accommodated us to the best that she can.  If we had questions, she answered honestly and didn't pressure us into ordering bad or pricey.\\n\\nFor our lunch, we ordered the French onion soup, soup du jour (parsnip and roasted garlic), porcini mushroom soup, sea scallops gratinees, steak frites with brandy peppercorn, sandwich du jour (open faced sandwich with sliced roast beef with micro greens and poached egg), and classic quiche Lorraine.  All of the food we ordered was absolutely yumm.  There is no complaint here!  We also ordered from the wine cart they have.  It's a cart filled with a selection of red and whites and you can have a mini tasting from which ever wine is being offered.  Our waitress was very generous with the pouring and for $8 per glass depending on the wine is well worth it.\\n\\nThis has definitely becoming a must for us everytime we play in Vegas!\",\n",
       " \"Ive eatten at every Mon Ami, I love them all.  This is my favorite of the bunch.  We celebrated the Mrs birthday, sat outside for hours eatting and watching the belagio water show.  You've got to request outdoor seating for the free water show.  Escargo app along scallops and oysters for apps.   Bone in rib eye for our meals and sauteed spinach with loads of garlic.   Holler!!!!!    Don't forget to dip your baguettes in the escargo garlic butter.  Tremendous meal.  Incredible service. They sang to my beautiful wife happy birthday and made my sons and friends join in.  Gorgi was our waitress and there is none better.  Every suggestion she offered we took and she was spot on right.  She talked me out of my usual seafood crepe and was I ever glad to try something different.  Love the service.  Love the food. And dessert was bananas fosters crepes.  This is a place you can't just try once. You have to come several times.  Brunch is so so good.  The menu is perfect and then some !!!!\",\n",
       " 'Pros: We came midday for lunch and it was busy, but patio seating was still plenty available and we were seated promptly. I highly recommend a patio seat as your view will be of the Bellagio Fountains across the street. Staff was polite, friendly, and made great recommendations. \\n\\nAbove all of this, the food was amazing! I had the chicken Brie sandwich and my husband had the lunch special seared tuna steak. Tuna steak was cooked to perfection and the sandwich described by the waiter as \"unique\" was uniquely bursting with favor. \\n\\nCons: Nothing. We loved our experience here. We highly recommend',\n",

Unfortunately, We were very disappointed. \\n\\nI ordered the corn beef and hash with egg whites and no hash browns sub fruit. To say the meal was EXTREMELY greasy would be an understatement. My husband ordered an egg white omelet with sausage and cheese and was very disappointed. He also ordered the side of bacon which was so over cooked it was close to beef jerky. His meal was also extremely greasy. Overall, the food was a bust. We will never eat here again. \\n\\nHowever, the atmosphere was awesome! We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the scenery.',\n",
       " \"Thanks, Yelpers!\\nWe were a party of five that wandered into the Paris Hotel for dinner Sunday night, found a list of the restaurants there, and used my phone to figure out which was right for us. We had a lovely meal in a beautiful pseudo-French setting (that looked very much like a Parisienne brasserie.  Service was nice; food was good.\\n\\nBe prepared if you're a pommes frites lover, these frites are more like freshly fried chips. We all liked them a lot, but I've never seen those in France.\\n\\nIf they're serving cold cucumber soup when you're there, get it. Absolutely great!\",\n",
       " \"Came by early one evening and scored a nice table outside facing the Strip and the Bellagio fountains.  You can't hear the music from the fountains, but it was a great meal.  There isn't any traffic noise from the Strip which was a big surprise.  Able to have a nice conversation at dinner.  No exhaust fumes either.  Furthermore, the space heaters kept us nice and warm.  No reservations for the patio, but if you go early enough like we did at 5p, you can score a table.  \\n\\nThe service was excellent.  I had the french onion soup and red wine and pepper steak and fries.  The food was very good.  Dessert was excellent too.  \\n\\nBecause the prices are pretty reasonable for a nice place in Vegas and the patio outside was so wonderful, I really recommend Mon Ami Gabi as as a dining destination in Vegas.\",\n",

       " \"UPFRONT DISCLAIMER: I'm not a fan of Las Vegas. Don't like the Oz-like fantasy world and the wretched excess of blatant consumerism that is thrust in your face from every angle. And I'm tired of holding my breath so as not to catch a case of cancer from all the cigarettes as I try to take a shortcut through some casino to get to the street! So I'm kinda prejudiced against just about anything in that town save the Bellagio fountains (how can you not get a kick out of that??!!) \\n\\nWhich brings up restaurants. More celeb restaurants per square foot here than anywhere else in the world and, quite frankly, it's all overkill. Most are factories with a big name attached. And yes, the food at these places can be decent. I just find them to be over-priced splurges for the masses who come here once a year on a big vacation!\\n\\nBut then there's Mon Ami Gabi. The only big name attached here is the Lettuce Entertain You folks out of Chicago who happen to run some pretty popular and very accessible restaurants from Chi-Town to Santa Monica. What they've done here at Paris, Paris is create a very friendly French Bistro & Terrace environment with pretty authentic French Bistro fare at a reasonable price -- all staged across the street from those killer fountains of Bellagio! This is not Alain Ducasse cuisine by ay stretch of the imagination but the recipes and preparations have integrity, the service is delivered with friendly attitude and the setting is cool.  Intimate it is not but you can find your own intimacy within the bustle and flow of the dining scene here. It's alive, glowing, engaging and delicious! We've been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner over several different trips and have always found it to be a good value, delicious and a pleasant escape from the frenetic antics of the Vegas denizens.\\n\\nI highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi! C'est si bon!\",\n",
       " \"The best time to go here is during lunch and you have to sit outside on the patio.  The reason I say lunch is because it's the best time to people watch and another the prices are very reasonable for its location. If you take a late lunch you also get the best view of the Bellagio water show as you eat.  I had the Brie and pear sandwich which was decadent and very well balanced and my husband got the seafood sandwich which was surprisingly refreshing.  I'm also a French fry addict and always have to order it no matter where I am and I have to say theirs were very good, they were thin cut and basic, but addicting.

From the moment we walked in to the moment we left was a complete disaster. Rude service, 45 min for eggs , McDonald's coffee can debated to be better quality.
